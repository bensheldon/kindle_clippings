  <h1>Getting to the Bottom of Top: Foundations of the Methodologies of the Technology of Participation</h1>
<h2>Wayne and Jo Nelson</h2>

<ul>
  
    <li>ToP methods of facilitating participation are much more than a neat way to get meetings to go somewhere. They aim to build off the deep undercurrents of history, deal with some major contradictions of our day, create a new paradigm of participation, and bring about profound transformations in people and society.</li>

When we objectify our feelings, preferences and expectations about something, we can observe our relationship to a concern as it is, rather than as we think it should be. We become open to our own reality.</li>
