    <li>John Bushland was a talented young photographer who was losing his hair early; hence his affectionate nickname. On several occasions he had tried to shoot the Siamese for an annual cat calendar, but they had been pointedly uncooperative.

After every disappointing effort he said, “I’m not licked yet!”</li>
