    <li>Iâ€™m going to summarize the existing research/literature on performance and business performance, but you can find a huge repository of these studies at wpostats.com.</li>
  
    <li>As performance-minded web developers, our job is to deliver the designer's vision in the most performant way possible. This is a screenshot of Rubygems.org's homepage.</li>
  
    <li>of combing through the CSS, I decided to approach the problem from first principles - what was the intent of the design? Why was Rubygems.org using WebFonts? Deciding on Design Intent Now, I am not a designer, and I don't pretend to be one on the internet. As developers, our job isn't to tell the designers "Hey, you're dumb for including over 500KB of WebFonts in your design!". That's not their job. As performance-minded web developers, our job is to deliver the designer's vision in the most performant way possible.</li>
  
    <li>Finally, I suggest setting a maximum average response time, or MART, for your site. The great thing about performance is that it's usually quite measurable - and what gets measured, gets managed! You may need two MART numbers - one that is achievable in development, with your developer hardware, and one that you use in production, with production hardware.</li>
