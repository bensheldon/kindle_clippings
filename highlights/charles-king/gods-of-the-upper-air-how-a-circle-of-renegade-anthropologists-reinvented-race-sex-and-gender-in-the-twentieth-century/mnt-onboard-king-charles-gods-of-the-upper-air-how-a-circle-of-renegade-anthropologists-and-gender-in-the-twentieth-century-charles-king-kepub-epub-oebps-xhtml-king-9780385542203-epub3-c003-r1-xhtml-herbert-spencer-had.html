<h1>Gods of the Upper Air: How a Circle of Renegade Anthropologists Reinvented Race, Sex, and Gender in the Twentieth Century</h1>

<p>Herbert Spencer had recently coined the term “survival of the fittest” to describe the fight for biological superiority outlined by Darwin in his On the Origin of Species (1859). For Spencer and other theorists, societies, too, were engaged in a struggle for survival, and nature itself determined which peoples would, through their superior achievements and worldviews, dominate the less providentially endowed. On the contrary, Powell claimed, social evolution was not at all like biological evolution. Change in society was instead a human-centered progression from lower to higher forms of thought, behavior, and institutions. No people was inherently incapable of completing the same transformative journey already taken by others. <strong>— : /mnt/onboard/King, Charles/Gods of the Upper Air_ How a Circle of Renegade Anthropologists, and Gender in the Twentieth Century - Charles King.kepub.epub!OEBPS!xhtml/King_9780385542203_epub3_c003_r1.xhtml</strong></p>
