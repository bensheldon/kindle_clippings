<h1>Gods of the Upper Air: How a Circle of Renegade Anthropologists Reinvented Race, Sex, and Gender in the Twentieth Century</h1>

<p>The drive to uncover the universal laws that determined the shape of individual lives—such as the consequences of dysgenic breeding, as with Emma Wolverton or Carrie Buck—seemed to be the obsessive purpose of many biologists, social scientists, and public policy advocates. For this reason, Boas said, “almost every anthropological problem touches our most intimate life.” When we think we are studying people out there, we are really making claims about people right here—about us and our neighbors, about our sense of the normal, the evident, and the standard.
			
			“We classify the variety of forms according to our previous experiences,” he wrote. Every society trains itself to see categories. Whom you love, whom you hate, the kind of person you’d be disgusted to see your daughter marry—none of these problems follow universal rules of attraction or repulsion. They are instead notions fired in the crucible of culture. The mobilization of sham science to justify bigotry might be said to be a deep characteristic of only one culture: that of the developed West. Northern Europeans and their diaspora, having conquered much of the world, predictably sought to remake it in their image. They filled it with imagined races and subtypes, imbeciles and geniuses, primitives and civilized men. They then declared their intellectual artifice to be deeply, provably natural, as unshakable as a god-made Valhalla. <strong>— : /mnt/onboard/King, Charles/Gods of the Upper Air_ How a Circle of Renegade Anthropologists, and Gender in the Twentieth Century - Charles King.kepub.epub!OEBPS!xhtml/King_9780385542203_epub3_c008_r1.xhtml</strong></p>
