<h1>Gods of the Upper Air: How a Circle of Renegade Anthropologists Reinvented Race, Sex, and Gender in the Twentieth Century</h1>

<p>“There is no evolution of moral ideas,” Boas wrote succinctly in 1928. The only thing that changes are the people we believe should be treated as full, purposive, and dignified human beings. This is the scientific finding and ethical disposition that Boas and his students wanted to share with the world. Focus less on the rules of correct behavior—eat this, don’t touch that, marry him, don’t speak to her—and more on the circle of humanity to which you believe the rules apply. Work hard at distancing yourself from ideas that feed your own sense of specialness. Figure out what your own society thinks of as its best behavior, then extend that to the most unlikely recipient of your goodwill—someone who might be living around the world or just down the street. Do this no matter how distasteful their beliefs and practices might be to you. <strong>— : /mnt/onboard/King, Charles/Gods of the Upper Air_ How a Circle of Renegade Anthropologists, and Gender in the Twentieth Century - Charles King.kepub.epub!OEBPS!xhtml/King_9780385542203_epub3_c014_r1.xhtml</strong></p>
