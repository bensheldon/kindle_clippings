<h2>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing</h2>

<ul>
  
    <li><p>The catalyst was a book called The Art of Discarding by Nagisa Tatsumi (Takarajimasha, Inc.), which explained the importance of getting rid of unnecessary things. <strong>— 15: 258-259</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>Tidying is just a tool, not the final destination. The true goal should be to establish the lifestyle you want most once your house has been put in order. <strong>— 21: 324-325</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>People have trouble discarding things that they could still use (functional value), that contain helpful information (informational value), and that have sentimental ties (emotional value). When these things are hard to obtain or replace (rarity), they become even harder to part with. <strong>— 45: 563-565</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>The process of deciding what to keep and what to discard will go much more smoothly if you begin with items that are easier to make decisions about. <strong>— 45: 565-566</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>The best sequence is this: clothes first, then books, papers, komono (miscellany), and lastly, mementos. This order has also proven to be the most efficient in terms of the level of difficulty for the subsequent task of storing. Finally, sticking to this sequence sharpens our intuitive sense of what items spark joy inside us. If you can dramatically accelerate the speed of the decision-making process just by changing the order in which you discard, don’t you think it’s worth a try? <strong>— 46: 569-573</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>The best time to start is early morning. The fresh morning air keeps your mind clear and your power of discernment sharp. For this reason, most of my lessons commence in the morning. <strong>— 58: 710-711</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>For the first category, clothing, I recommend dividing further into the following subcategories to increase efficiency: Tops (shirts, sweaters, etc.) Bottoms (pants, skirts, etc.) Clothes that should be hung (jackets, coats, suits, etc.) Socks Underwear Bags (handbags, messenger bags, etc.) Accessories (scarves, belts, hats, etc.) Clothes for specific events (swimsuits, kimonos, uniforms, etc.) Shoes And, yes, I include handbags and shoes as clothing. <strong>— 65: 760-769</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>Arrange your clothes so that they rise to the right. <strong>— 79: 914-914</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>The basic order for sorting komono is as follows: 1. CDs, DVDs 2. Skin care products 3. Makeup 4. Accessories 5. Valuables (passports, credit cards, etc.) 6. Electrical equipment and appliances (digital cameras, electric cords, anything that seems vaguely “electric”) 7. Household equipment (stationary and writing materials, sewing kits, etc.) 8. Household supplies (expendables like medicine, detergents, tissues, etc.) 9. Kitchen goods/food supplies (spatulas, pots, blenders, etc.) 10. Other (spare change, figurines, etc.) <strong>— 106: 1207-1214</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>Clutter is caused by a failure to return things to where they belong. Therefore, storage should reduce the effort needed to put things away, not the effort needed to get them out. <strong>— 142: 1568-1569</strong></p>
</li>
  
</ul>
