<h1>The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World</h1>

<p>The dualism between the external and the internal world had preoccupied philosophers for millennia. It was a question that asks: Is the tree that I’m seeing in my garden the idea of that tree or the real tree? For a scientist such as Humboldt who was trying to understand nature, this was the most important question. Humans were like citizens of two worlds, occupying both the world of the Ding an sich (the thing-in-itself) which was the external world, and the internal world of one’s perception (how things ‘appeared’ to individuals). According to Kant, the ‘thing-in-itself’ could never be truly known, while the internal world was always subjective. What Kant brought to the table was the so-called transcendental level: the concept that when we experience an object, it becomes a ‘thing-as-it-appears-to-us’. Our senses as much as our reason are like tinted spectacles through which we perceive the world. <strong>— 51: 639-646</strong></p>
