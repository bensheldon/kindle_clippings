<h1>Crossing the Bar: The Adventures of a San Francisco Bay Bar Pilot</h1>

<p>Once I jokingly asked a doctor friend of mine from Lake Merced Golf Club if he was a good hand surgeon. He replied, “No, but I’m a lucky one,” so I called Gordon “Lucky” after that. That may sound droll, but you have to have a certain amount of luck piloting ships, just as you do in golf, or life for that matter, because not everything works out the way you planned it. Like Gordon, I’d rather be a lucky pilot than a good one. Andy Ugarte, a dear Peruvian friend of mine, was very successful. He thought success was achieved by being smart, but you also needed luck. You needed to be in the right place at the right time, which is what happened with Captain Sever. I was surprised how many pilots agreed on one thing; we all used body English to help move ships out of harm’s way. This is the equivalent of golfers talking to their balls. I caught myself moving my hips a few times, hoping to shove a huge ship sideways to avoid trouble. I mumbled a few prayers when ships got too damn close to something. Considering how shallow San Francisco Bay is, it must have helped, because I was only aground three times, and twice it wasn’t my fault. <strong>— 295: 4387-4395</strong></p>
