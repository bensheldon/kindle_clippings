<h1>Future Ethics</h1>

<p>Every business textbook offers a step-by-step guide to stakeholder analysis, but most only cover teammates or suspiciously homogenous groups like ‘users’ or ‘residents’. This perspective, reinforced by the individualist focus of user-centred design, means we often overlook important groups. Stakeholders aren’t just the people who can affect a project; they’re also the people the project might affect. To force ourselves to consider the right people, try using a prompt list (see appendix) to capture a wider range of potential stakeholders, and use this as an input to futuring exercises and the design process. Not all stakeholders will be welcome. In some cases, it might be worth including, say, a criminal, terrorist, or troll as a negative stakeholder – a persona non grata25 – so the team can discuss how to actively reduce the harm this person can do. He may even deserve full persona treatment, with a name, an abusive scenario, and listed motivations to increase his profile within the team. Stakeholders could even include social concepts: things we value in society but rarely consider within our influence, such as democracy, justice, or freedom of the press. As we now know, technology has the power to damage these ideas; explicitly listing them as stakeholders, or at least acknowledging their potential vulnerability, might help us protect them. <strong>— 40: 512-522</strong></p>
