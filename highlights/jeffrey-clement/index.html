  <h2>The Lieutenant Don't Know: One Marine's Story of Warfare and Combat Logistics in Afghanistan</h2>

<ul>
  
    <li><p>Before the incident, Corporal Dunham had debated the strength of the Kevlar helmet with some squadmates and his platoon commander. Dunham theorized that even if the Kevlar might not protect the Marine holding it down from the blast of a grenade, it would definitely save the other Marines around him. His squadmates doubted that somebody could get their helmet off in time to get it on top of the grenade and hold it down with their body. Corporal Dunham practiced this maneuver. He would unfasten his helmet, throw it down and jump on top of it. There was no way he could have known he would later use this same technique to save the lives of his fellow Marines in Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines. While attempting to detain an insurgent in Al-Karabilah, Iraq, a hand- to-hand struggle ensued. The insurgent pulled out a grenade intending to kill himself, Corporal Dunham, and two other Marines. Corporal Dunham disengaged from fighting the man, unclipped his chin strap, covered the grenade with his helmet and pressed his body atop it. He saved the lives of his two comrades, but was mortally wounded in the process. It was a sacrifice he made without hesitation, and for this he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Major Gibson told this story with tears in his eyes. “Ownership,” he said, “is the touchstone of leadership. There are three rules of leadership that I have learned over the years, and Corporal Dunham exemplified all three with this one act. First, leadership by example. “Second, self-sacrifice for the greater good. Be willing to do anything for your Marines. Give everything you have, and then give some more. Tear yourself to the ground. “Lastly, one man can make a difference.” <strong>— : 619</strong></p>
