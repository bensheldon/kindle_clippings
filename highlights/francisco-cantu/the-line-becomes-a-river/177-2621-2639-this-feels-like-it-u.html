<h1>The Line Becomes a River</h1>

<p>This feels like it used to feel, she finally said. I stopped walking. I don’t understand, I told her. It’s like when you were on the border, she said. All those years I knew things were weighing on you, but you were so sensitive to my questions—I couldn’t ask about it, I couldn’t show concern, I could never reach you. I don’t want that again. I’m too tired for it now. I stood for a while at the side of the street, staring out at the houses of my neighbors. Finally, I sat down on the curb. When did you know? I asked. She paused. Something had gone away from our conversations, she said. I don’t know how to describe it. She searched for a better explanation. There’s a story I remember from Catholic school, she told me. There was this brilliant child, a music prodigy. He could play anything—he would hear birds sing and then turn it into music. At a very young age he was sent away to be trained by monks. When he arrived at the monastery they forbade him from hearing any music but his own, they forbade him from listening to any of the famous composers. They wanted him to write and create his own music, and for many years he did—he created the most phenomenal things. But as he got a bit older he became frustrated. He wanted to study, he wanted to hear other kinds of music. And so one day he snuck away from the monastery. He went to a nearby town and went into a concert hall, where he heard Mozart. When he came back, he didn’t tell anyone, he kept creating new music just like before. A few days after his return, the monks heard him playing and they told him to stop. You’ve broken the rule, they told him. He looked at them with panic and insisted, no I haven’t, I haven’t, I haven’t. They shook their heads and said, yes you have, you’ve discovered Mozart. No, he said, how could you know that? Because, they said, when you played without knowing, you played music from every composer—and now Mozart is missing. When she finished the story, my mother fell silent. I sat hunched on the curb, the phone pressed against my ear. My friend, I finally told her, he’s been deported. I felt unable to breathe. I fear for him, I said, I fear for his family. All these years, I told her, it’s like I’ve been circling beneath a giant, my gaze fixed upon its foot resting at the ground. But now, I said, it’s like I’m starting to crane my head upward, like I’m finally seeing the thing that crushes. <strong>— 177: 2621-2639</strong></p>
