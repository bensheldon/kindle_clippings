<h1>Polostan</h1>

<p>Drawing Ordzhonikidze’s eye, Proton said, “It is as if a few scientists discovered a new continent with thousands of hitherto            unknown species of butterflies. Catching them all and drawing pictures of them is going to take awhile. But the possibility            exists that at least one of them might be a magic butterfly that gives its discoverer powers we thought were reserved to wizards            and gods.”“That’s theunsaid bit,” his father emphasized. “Talk to any of those scientists and they’ll pooh-pooh the ‘wizards and gods’ bit and insist            they’re just butterfly collectors.”Whether or not it was the case that Oleksandr Fizmatov was really being that clever—that devious—the fact of the matter was            that this sort of explanation jibed perfectly with the way men like Beria and Ordzhonikidze were wont to view the world. Namely            that the outward pretenses maintained by important men—scientists, in this case—concealed subtle and hidden motives, and that            to understand as much was to be sophisticated and therefore strong. <strong>— : /mnt/onboard/Stephenson, Neal/Polostan - Neal Stephenson.kepub.epub!!Chapter_17.xhtml#ch20</strong></p>
