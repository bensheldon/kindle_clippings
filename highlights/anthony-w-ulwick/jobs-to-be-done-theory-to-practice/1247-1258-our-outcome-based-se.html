<h1>Jobs to be Done: Theory to Practice</h1>

<p>Our Outcome-Based Segmentation methodology is executed in four steps: First we analyze the Job-to-be-Done and capture all the customers’ needs in the form of desired outcome statements. (The special syntax of these outcome statements guarantees precision and comparability). Next, we field a survey that is administered to a statistically valid representative sample of customers (usually between 180 and 3,000 customers). Their answers reveal how important it is that they achieve each outcome and how well the solution they use today satisfies each outcome. With this data we determine which outcomes are most under-and overserved. Under-and overserved outcomes represent innovation opportunities. Third, we use factor analysis and cluster analysis to segment the market into groups of customers with unique sets of unmet desired outcomes. Lastly, we use profiling questions we include in the survey to understand what factors cause complexity and make some customers struggle more than others to get the job done. The survey also collects information that reveals the degree to which the different segments we uncovered are underserved. <strong>— : 1247-1258</strong></p>
