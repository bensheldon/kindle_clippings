<h1>Jobs to be Done: Theory to Practice</h1>

<p>To identify opportunities for product innovation, the Bosch team targeted professional tradesmen (the job executors) who were responsible for cutting wood in a straight line (the Job-to-be-Done). They targeted roofers, framers, contractors, finish carpenters, plumbers and electricians. Through interviews with the professional tradesmen, the ODI practitioner dissected the Job-to-be-Done into its component parts through the use of a job map and worked to capture a complete set of approximately 85 desired outcome statements. Next, ODI-based quantitative research methods were employed. Through a controlled online survey, approximately 270 professional tradesmen rated each desired outcome statement for (i) its level of importance, and (ii) the degree to which it was satisfied, given the circular saws they were currently using. This data was used to run a variety of data analyses (Outcome-Based Segmentation, competitive analysis, etc.). <strong>â€” : 1823-1831</strong></p>
