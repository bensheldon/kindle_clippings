<h1>Transformational Strategy : Facilitation of ToP Participatory Planning</h1>

<p>It happens first at a very personal level. Participants say their voices are heard and their ideas treated with respect. They understand how their practical decisions affect the direction of the organization or community. They know how to have a positive effect on their own future. They have deeper respect for others in the organization. They understand their situation better, because they have integrated the perspectives of others with their own. They talk about assuming greater responsibility for the whole organization, because they have participated in determining what is necessary. They want to expand their personal capacities in ways they have not used before. Second, they see a change in other people. They notice people listening more carefully, being less fearful of new situations, and building up the confidence that comes with accomplishing goals as a team. They notice colleagues trying out creative, innovative solutions to previously insoluble problems. They recognize that the group as a whole is demonstrating values, exhibiting behaviors, and generating results. Everyone is taking more interest in their work.  Third, they talk about the positive impact that the organization is having on its intended stakeholders or on society. They mention how the organization has a new story about its role, and how that story is being acted upon. They refer to a new courage in the organization’s ability to act, and how this courage is not simply vested in the leadership at the top, but is imbedded throughout the organization. It seems that the old riddle of “What comes first … personal transformation? Or social transformation?” has been solved. They occur simultaneously, with a feedback loop from one to the other. <strong>— : 328-343</strong></p>
