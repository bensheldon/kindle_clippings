<h1>Fulfillment</h1>

<p>For those on the Point, the war was giving new purpose to work that, for many, was already more rewarding than such arduous labor might seem. Here’s how Mike Howard described working in the open-hearth furnace to Mark Reutter: “I felt good. When you’re in your prime, physical work is a challenge, and if you’re working with other people, there is a certain pride in being on top of the job. The demands of the work bred a kind of man who was fiercely committed to this work.” Howard distinguished between “brutalizing work” and “challenging work”: “In the open hearth, you had to cope with problems that involved metallurgy, that involved blacksmithing, that involved judgment. These were not guys who were a bunch of punch-drunk wrestlers. They were bright. There were split-second decisions that had to be made. There were a lot of challenges that kept you on your toes.” <strong>— 110: 1847-1855</strong></p>
