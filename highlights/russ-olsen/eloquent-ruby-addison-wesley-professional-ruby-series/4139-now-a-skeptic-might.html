<h1>Eloquent Ruby (Addison-Wesley Professional Ruby Series)</h1>

<p>Now, a skeptic might observe that neither replace_firstname nor replace_lastcarmodelbought have added any particularly new capability to the FormLetter class.1 These two methods, however they are implemented, simply expose an existing feature of the FormLetter class in a slightly different package. So why should we bother? We bother because our users asked us to bother. If you reread my tale of intrigue and junk mail, you’ll see that it was the coders who were using the FormLetter class that asked for the convenience methods. Those methods make the code generating the form letters cleaner and easier for the people who count—the programmers who need to deal with it. One of the key values of the Ruby programming culture is that the look of the code matters. It matters because the people who use the code, read the code, and maintain the code matter. Good software engineering is all about making everyone’s job easier, not just because we want to go home on time but because we all want to turn out the best possible end product. So we add convenience methods, build method_missing methods, and go to enormous lengths to make our APIs easy to use because programmers with easy-to-use APIs tend to have the time to craft easy-to-use—and working—systems. <strong>— : 4139</strong></p>
