<h1>Eloquent Ruby (Addison-Wesley Professional Ruby Series)</h1>

<p>If you feel like this technique has left you in a confusing maze of twisty passages,3 here are some signposts that can help. First, keep your goal firmly in mind. In our example, we wanted to make it easy to add paragraph-generating methods to StructuredDocument subclasses. Second, know when things happen. For example, when you load the StructuredDocument code, perhaps with this: require 'structured_document' You end up with the generic StructuredDocument class, which has the paragraph_type class method on it. A bit later (perhaps even on the very next line of code) you load the Instructions class: require 'instructions' As the Instructions class definition is getting executed, it will fire off calls to the paragraph_type method up in the StructuredDocument class. This will add methods with names like introduction, warning, and step to the Instructions class. Only when all of this defining is over do you make an instance of Instructions and call the generated methods. The third thing to know is that the value of self is at every stage of this process. This starts out relatively straightforward but gets a little hairy as you go along. The straightforward bit is in the superclass: <strong>â€” : 4647</strong></p>
