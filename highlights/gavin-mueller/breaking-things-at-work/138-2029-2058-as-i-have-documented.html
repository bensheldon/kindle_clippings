<h1>Breaking Things at Work</h1>

<p>As I have documented in the preceding chapters, workers’ movements of the past two centuries often had a Luddish bent: they understood new machines as weapons wielded against them in their struggles for a better life, and treated them as such. Intellectuals on both sides of the class struggle often characterized this perspective as shortsightedness, or downright irrationality. In spite of their political commitments to the working class, Marxist theoreticians often saw the capitalist development of technology as the means for creating both abundance and leisure, which would be realized once the masses finally took the reins of government and industry. These arguments continue to be made today: to take two examples, Leigh Phillips and Michal Rozworski’s People’s Republic of Walmart sees the discount retailer as the anticipation of socialist logistics, and Aaron Bastani’s Fully Automated Luxury Communism devotes itself to speculative technologies like driverless cars and asteroid mining, with a “communist” coda at the end.1 Both works self-consciously pitch themselves as restoring faith in a progressive, but politically neutral, technological telos, against a left politics that is small scale and “primitivist.” It is my contention, supported by the history of thought and action in the preceding pages, that the radical left can and should put forth a decelerationist politics: a politics of slowing down change, undermining technological progress, and limiting capital’s rapacity, while developing organization and cultivating militancy. Letting Walmart or Amazon swallow the globe not only entrenches exploitative models of production and distribution; it channels resources to reactionary billionaires who use their wealth to further undermine the relative position of workers by funding conservative causes like tax cuts, school privatization, and opposition to gay marriage.2 Letting technology take its course will lead not to egalitarian outcomes, but authoritarian ones, as the ultra-wealthy expend their resources on shielding themselves from any accountability to the rest of us: postapocalyptic bunkers, militarized yachts, private islands, and even escapes to outer space.3 Decelerationist politics is not the same as the “slow lifestyle” politics popular among segments of the better-off: “ways of being,” as Carl Honoré puts it in the movement’s manifesto, In Praise of Slowness, that emphasize “calm, careful, receptive, still, intuitive, unhurried, patient, reflective, quality-over-quantity.”4 As pleasing as slow aesthetics might be, I am not content to ground my argument in claims that a particular pace of life is “a more natural, human” one,5 nor do I seek, as Honoré does, to give the capitalist system “a human face.”6 The argument for deceleration is not based on satisfying nature, human or otherwise, but in recognizing the challenges facing strategies for organizing the working class. The constant churn of recomposition and reorganization, what media scholar Nick Dyer-Witheford calls “the digital vortex” of contemporary capitalism, scarcely gives workers time to get back on their feet, let alone fight.7 Decelerationism is not a withdrawal to a slower pace of life, but the manifestation of an antagonism toward the progress of elites at the expense of the rest of us. It is Walter Benjamin’s emergency brake. It is a wrench in the gears. This is to say, my argument is not based on lifestyle, or even ethics; it is based on politics. <strong>— 138: 2029-2058</strong></p>
