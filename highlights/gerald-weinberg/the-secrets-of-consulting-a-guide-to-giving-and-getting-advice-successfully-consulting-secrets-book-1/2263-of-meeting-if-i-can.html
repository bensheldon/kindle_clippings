<h1>The Secrets of Consulting: A Guide to Giving and Getting Advice Successfully (Consulting Secrets Book 1)</h1>

<p>of meeting. If I can improve a client's meeting-effectiveness, my consulting task is simplified, and the client retains the benefits long after I've gone. The Hidden Agenda is one of the techniques I use to train people to "see" inside others. I use the following technique. Before a meeting begins, I give each participant a sheet of paper on which is written a secret personal assignment for that meeting. Here are some examples of such secret assignments: • Try to see to it that every decision the meeting takes is written down and displayed so all can view it. • Make sure that every person gets a chance to talk on every topic. • Do not let any single person or clique dominate the meeting. • Pretend that you have not prepared for this meeting, and try to conceal that fact from everyone else throughout the entire meeting. • If at all possible, see that the meeting comes to decision X without letting yourself be identified with that decision. The typical secret assignment describes something that people normally do in meetings, with some assignments having a positive effect, some negative, and some neutral. By playing the role explicitly, the actor learns to "see" behavior that was previously invisible, or to see alternative interpretations for behavior that was previously visible. This new vision inevitably affects a person's future understanding of meetings. Two secret assignments I frequently use are these: • Pretend you have another meeting to attend following this one. You very much want to attend that meeting, so do everything you can to make this meeting end as quickly as possible. • Pretend you have another meeting to attend following this one. You very much want to miss that meeting, which you can do if this one runs overtime. Do everything you can to make this meeting last as long as possible. By using both of these secret assignments in the same meeting, I make it possible for everyone to see how the conflict works out. At the end of the meeting, I post a list of the secret assignments, and ask the observers to guess who had which. Without fail, the person assigned the "quick meeting" agenda is misidentified as the "prolonged meeting" person! <strong>— : 2263</strong></p>
