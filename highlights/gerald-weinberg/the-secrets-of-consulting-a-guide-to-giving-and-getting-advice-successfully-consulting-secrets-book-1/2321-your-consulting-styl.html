<h1>The Secrets of Consulting: A Guide to Giving and Getting Advice Successfully (Consulting Secrets Book 1)</h1>

<p>Your consulting style will reflect an increasingly complex understanding of your task and will have the following characteristics: • Your task is to influence people, but only at their request. • You strive to make people less dependent on you, rather than more dependent. • You try to obey The Law of the Jiggle: The less you actually intervene, the better you feel about your work. • If your clients want help in solving problems, you are able to say no. • If you say yes but fail, you can live with that. If you succeed, the least satisfying approach is when you solve the problem for them. • More satisfying is to help them solve their problems in such a way that they will be more likely to solve the next problem without help. • Most satisfying is to help them learn how to prevent problems in the first place. • You can be satisfied with your accomplishments, even if clients don't give you credit. • Your ideal form of influence is first to help people see their world more clearly, and then to let them decide what to do next. • Your methods of working are always open for display and discussion with your clients. • Your primary tool is merely being the person you are, so your most powerful method of helping other people is to help yourself. <strong>— : 2321</strong></p>
