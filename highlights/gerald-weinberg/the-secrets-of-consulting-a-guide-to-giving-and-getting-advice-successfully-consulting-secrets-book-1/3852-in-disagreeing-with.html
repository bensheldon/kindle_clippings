<h1>The Secrets of Consulting: A Guide to Giving and Getting Advice Successfully (Consulting Secrets Book 1)</h1>

I can get facts wrong myself, so it's reasonable to expect that other people can, too. Most people can accept the idea that even though they are sure of some fact, you, as a consultant and an outsider, need to find out for yourself. If they strongly resist this perfectly reasonable idea, then their resistance itself is an important fact that you should examine before going further. Why? Because they might be lying? But isn't that mistrusting their integrity? <strong>â€” : 3852</strong></p>
