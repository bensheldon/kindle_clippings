<h1>The Secrets of Consulting: A Guide to Giving and Getting Advice Successfully (Consulting Secrets Book 1)</h1>

<p>According to legend, Henry Ford was once interviewed by Congress on the question of how to prevent river pollution caused by industrial plants. Ford pooh-poohed all the complex legislation that Congress was considering, proposing instead a single law that would "end river pollution once and for all." Congress didn't pass the law, but its two parts are worth remembering: 1. People can take any amount of water from any stream to use for any purpose desired. 2. People must return an equal amount of water upstream from the point from which they took it. In other words, people can do what they want with water, as long as they themselves have to live with the consequences. <strong>â€” : 2606</strong></p>
