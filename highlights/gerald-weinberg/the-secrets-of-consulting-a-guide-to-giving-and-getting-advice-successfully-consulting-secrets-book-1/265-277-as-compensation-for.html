<h1>The Secrets of Consulting: A Guide to Giving and Getting Advice Successfully (Consulting Secrets Book 1)</h1>

<p>As compensation for losing the intimacy of dishwashing, the consultant gains the satisfaction of a much wider effect on the world's gunk, grease, and grime. In the time it would take to wash a hundred mugs, I can advise two other people on how to do the job in my absence. What I lose in quality, I gain in quantity. As a dishwashing trainer, I intensify the quality/quantity tradeoff, because training is merely a cheaper form of consulting. Instead of giving one client my undivided attention, I design a workshop that can handle fifteen or twenty. Each participant gets a little less, but the cost goes down, so the market for my message expands. Sure, a couple will miss some essential point, and may leave their dishes actually grungier than before. But isn't it worth it to spread the word? As a dishwashing lecturer, I can spread my consulting advice even further, reaching several hundred avid clients at one time. True, some of them may be sleeping with their eyes open, and a few might even think I said to rub peanut butter on, rather than off. But shouldn't I think of the greater good for the greater number? But why stop there? Through the twin miracles of the printing press and internet, I can reach hundreds of thousands of clients with my sterling advice. If my book on dishwashing is a bestseller, I might even reach millions! And earn millions! <strong>â€” : 265-277</strong></p>
