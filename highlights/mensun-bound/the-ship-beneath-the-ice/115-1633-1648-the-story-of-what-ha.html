<h1>The Ship Beneath the Ice</h1>

<p>The story of what happened to those men after they left England has been shaped almost entirely by South, which was presented as a factual record of their epic journey. The book appeared in 1919, three years after they got back from Antarctica, and (the ultimate accolade in publishing) has never been out of print since. Back in the ‘60s, when I first read South, I was happy to go along with its every word, but now I am not so naive – now I want to get closer to the truth of what happened. South was all about myth creation. Shackleton was hungry for fame and fortune and to be seen and adored as a hero. This he had achieved with the publication of The Heart of Antarctica, about the Nimrod expedition, in 1909; but that book was later knocked into the shadows by the 1913 publication of Scott’s harrowing diaries, which established him as the pre-eminent British explorer of the era. Scott might have been dead, but the bitter rivalry between the two continued. South was Shackleton’s last chance to carve his name in legend and, if not eclipse Scott, at least ensure his place beside him. For books of this type there was a template which, fortunately for Shackleton, perfectly matched the vision of himself that he wanted to project: the noble hero, the fearless leader of a loyal, selfless, body of men who, inspired by his example, worked seamlessly for the good of all. In other words, the perfect expression of the Imperial ideal. Certainly there was much to admire in those 28 who went into the Antarctic on the Endurance – they were a remarkable group, capable of great fortitude and generosity of spirit, and they were in large part loyal and brave. But, as the diaries reveal, they could also be snarky, nitpicking, jealous, self-serving and vindictive. They were not, every one of them, chin-up and valiant-all, and they were definitely no band of brothers. In short, they were – as my mother used to say when I was venting my frustration over some bonehead who was complicating my life – ‘people, dear. Just people <strong>— 115: 1633-1648</strong></p>
