<h1>The Ship Beneath the Ice</h1>

<p>the star in our firmament is undoubtedly Nico Vincent. I think he might have saved the project. Back in Sweden, when he was taking charge of the Sabertooths, he spotted an old winch in storage and asked if he could also have that one for the project. Everybody was of the opinion that the two new ones would be entirely reliable, but Nico’s view was that they were not tried and tested, whereas the old one, despite its years, was. Both of the new winches have now failed and so Nico has switched to the 25-year-old winch, and it is working. It did not like the cold, but they constructed a tent over it and put a heater inside, and it has performed perfectly. The subsea team say that bringing the old winch was an act of whim, but to me it betokens the kind of wisdom that only comes with experience. <strong>— 276: 3969-3975</strong></p>
