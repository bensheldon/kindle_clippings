<h1>The Ship Beneath the Ice</h1>

<p>There were great bergs and floes all around. It was as if we were in a maze. I watched the mate as he wove the ship back and forth between channels. After a manoeuvre that reminded me of a racing car going through a chicane, I threw him a compliment. ‘Nifty,’ I said. He gave a rare smile. ‘I’ve got more moves than a fiddle player’s elbow.’ Good one, I thought; but Shackleton said it better when he compared it to ‘steering a bicycle through a graveyard’. This expression came to him at the end of the 1903 season when, on Scott’s orders and very much against his own wishes, he was being invalided out of Antarctica on a relief ship.
