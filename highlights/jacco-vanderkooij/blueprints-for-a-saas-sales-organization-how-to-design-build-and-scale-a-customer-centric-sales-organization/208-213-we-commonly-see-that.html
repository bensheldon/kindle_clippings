<h1>Blueprints For A SaaS Sales Organization: How to design, build and scale a customer centric sales organization</h1>

<p>We commonly see that the companies who are successful in SaaS are successful in the SMB space, and it is these companies that also obtain high valuation. We have seen first hand how companies who achieve success early-on with large Enterprise deals, find themselves circling the drain a few years later. The success with enterprise deals, required these companies to focus on integration instead of innovation. On the other hand clients that enter the market from a freemium/prosumer model are able to adopt quickly. Although many are prematurely stamped “successfull” by industry pundits, experienced VCs will tell you that they only warrant the valuation once success is achieved in the SMB space. <strong>— : 208-213</strong></p>
