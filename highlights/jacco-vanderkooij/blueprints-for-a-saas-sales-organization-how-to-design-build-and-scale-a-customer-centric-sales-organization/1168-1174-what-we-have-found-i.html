<h1>Blueprints For A SaaS Sales Organization: How to design, build and scale a customer centric sales organization</h1>

<p>What we have found is that laying out a very clear progression path marked by 3 month intervals is absolutely crucial to keeping entry level sales personnel motivated, possibly even more important than their commission structure. So our blueprint lays out a series of steps that can be made clear to entry level salespeople. The message on the first day of training needs to be that if they succeed as an MDR, in a matter of months they will be able to graduate to a different role, building skills as they go. And as they rapidly move through the progression above, they acquire skills that are valuable across the entire organization, giving you a perfect talent development pool with inbuilt high turnover and the ability to move stars elsewhere in your organization. <strong>â€” : 1168-1174</strong></p>
