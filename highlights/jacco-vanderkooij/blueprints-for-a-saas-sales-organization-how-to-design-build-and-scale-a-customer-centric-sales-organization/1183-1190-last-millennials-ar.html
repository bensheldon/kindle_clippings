<h1>Blueprints For A SaaS Sales Organization: How to design, build and scale a customer centric sales organization</h1>

<p>Last, Millennials are often called impatient. Or distracted. “A-D-D!” screams your VP of Sales when describing your incoming class and their short attention spans. The truth is rather more uncomfortable and hard to face: these young people have no patience for YOU. For your lecturing, for how long it takes you to get to the point, for your bullshit. They will listen for as long as you are conveying something useful, and no longer. What this means is you have get very efficient at conveying information and get rid of hierarchy.  In practice that means moving to standing meetings with a maximum length of 15 minutes in which everyone is given equal time. What it also means is that you have to structure learning so that your teams are teaching each other, rather than getting lectured at by a trainer or an executive. You may feel like this will take an inordinate amount of work. Of course it will! Changing the way you do things always takes work. But you adapt to changes in your customers, so you should adapt equally well to changes in your workforce. <strong>— : 1183-1190</strong></p>
