<h1>Blueprints For A SaaS Sales Organization: How to design, build and scale a customer centric sales organization</h1>

<p>We put a rocket on the cover of our book for a reason, and that reason is that a rocket represents the culmination of what is possible when you carefully design a system of trial and error to improve incrementally. We know, sales is not rocket science. As sales professionals we have heard that way too often in fact. But we believe deeply that sales is not an art. It is a science, and it is becoming more of a science each day. And just like astronauts are no longer balls-to-the-wall test pilots but instead trained engineers, the men and women who practice sales today are highly trained, data driven professionals who rely on process to gain incremental improvements. So what is it that sets apart your rocket science sales organization? Process. Documented process that results in controlled experimentation and deliberate learning which leads to success at scale. So when we hear about sales organizations that lack the ability to forecast accurately how the month will end, or when only 60% of sales professionals hit quota, we ask is that a problem of bad performers? Bad sales leadership? A bad service? The wrong clients? We say no ... we say you simply lack the process to learn and improve on. Or to nicely close out our analogy - you are trying to launch a rocket to Mars without having built a process that results in a Mars landing as the inevitable culmination of a process. <strong>â€” : 741-753</strong></p>
