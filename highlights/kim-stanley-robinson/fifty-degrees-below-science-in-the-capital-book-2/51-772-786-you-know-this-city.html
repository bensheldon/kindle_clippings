<h1>Fifty Degrees Below (Science in the Capital Book 2)</h1>

<p>“You know, this city and the Federal government are synonymous. They stand for each other, like when people call the administration ‘the White House.’ What is that, metonymy?” “Metonymy or synecdoche, I can never remember which.” “No one can.” Phil walked inside, stopped short at the sight of the stained inner walls. “Damn it. They are going to let this city sink back into the swamp it came out of.” “That’s synecdoche I think. Or the pathetic fallacy.” “Pathetic for sure, but how is it patriotic? How do they sell that?” “Please Phil, you’re gonna wake him up. They have it both ways, you know. They use code phrases that mean something different to the Christian right than to anyone else.” “Like the beast will be slain or whatnot?” “Yes, and sometimes even more subtle than that.” “Ha ha. Clerics, everywhere you look. Ours are as bad as the foreign ones. Make people hate their government at the same time you’re scaring them with terrorists, what kind of program is that?” Phil drifted through the subdued crowd toward the left wall, into which was incised the Gettysburg Address. The final lines were obscured by the flood’s high-water mark, a sight which made him scowl. “They had better clean this up.” “Oh they will. He was a Republican, after all.” “Abraham Lincoln was no Republican.” “Hello?” <strong>— 51: 772-786</strong></p>
