<h1>Build Better Products</h1>

<p>To frame intent, Avinash divides customer behavior into four clusters: See, Think, Do, and Care: • See: These are people who have no current intent to purchase a product like yours, but they could still be in your market. They’re probably interested in the space your product inhabits. • Think: These are people who are thinking about products in your category, but they’re not actively considering buying right now. • Do: These are people who are actively in purchase mode or have just purchased your product. • Care: These are your current most valuable, loyal users. Let’s look at an example. Imagine that you own a gym, and you’re wondering whom to reach in order to make more revenue. Here are your intent clusters: • See: These are folks who are likely to care about their health and well being. • Think: These are the people who have noticed that they’re putting on a little weight and are thinking about ways to take it off. • Do: People in this cluster are actively looking for a gym and may have even come in to check out your facilities or have used a guest pass to try out some classes. • Care: These people already belong to your gym, come regularly, and tell their friends all about their personal trainers. <strong>— 340: 6323-6338</strong></p>
