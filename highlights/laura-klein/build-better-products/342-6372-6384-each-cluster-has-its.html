<h1>Build Better Products</h1>

<p>Each cluster has its own metrics that you want to measure in order to judge whether your efforts to reach people are working: • See Metrics: Conversation rate (how much people are talking about you), amplification rate, applause rate, and subscribers. Watch social media to see who’s talking about your product and whether people are sharing the content you’re putting out. • Think Metrics: Click-through rate, page depth, and percent assisted. These are metrics for your marketing website or blog or newsletter—however you’re delivering content—that show how deeply people are engaging with the information you’re delivering them and whether that outreach is eventually leading to a purchase. • Do Metrics: Visitor loyalty, checkout/abandonment rate, conversion, and profit. Again, the Do cluster is all about purchasing, so the metrics you care about will be those dealing with whether visitors make it all the way through the purchase process. • Care Metrics: Repeat purchases, likelihood to recommend, and lifetime value. For this cluster, you care about keeping users around for the long haul and getting them excited enough to turn them into brand advocates so that their value to you increases over time. <strong>— 342: 6372-6384</strong></p>
