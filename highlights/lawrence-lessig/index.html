<h1>Lawrence Lessig</h1>


  <h2>Free Culture</h2>

<ul>
  
    <li><p>The Wright brothers spat airplanes into the technological meme pool; <strong>— 13: 153-153</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>As Lawrence Lessing described it, <strong>— 16: 196-196</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>We can glimpse a sense of this change by distinguishing between commercial and noncommercial culture, and by mapping the law’s regulation of each. By “commercial culture” I mean that part of our culture that is produced and sold or produced to be sold. By “noncommercial culture” I mean all the rest. When old men sat around parks or on street corners telling stories that kids and others consumed, that was noncommercial culture. When Noah Webster published his “Reader,” or Joel Barlow his poetry, that was commercial culture. <strong>— 18: 226-229</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>Richard Florida <strong>— 29: 370-370</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>The twenty-first century could be different. This is the crucial point: It could be both read and write. Or at least reading and better understanding the craft of writing. Or best, reading and understanding the tools that enable the writing to lead or mislead. The aim of any literacy, and this literacy in particular, is to “empower people to choose the appropriate language for what they need to create or express.”13 It is to enable students “to communicate in the language of the twenty-first century.” <strong>— 48: 635-639</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>Winer told me. “An amateur journalist simply doesn’t have a conflict of interest, or the conflict of interest is so easily disclosed that you know you can sort of get it out of the way.” <strong>— 56: 742-743</strong></p>
</li>
  
</ul>
