<p>Although the corporation struggled on until Campbell’s death in 1966, it provided no evidence that industrial farms were superior to family farms in efficiency and profitability. The advantages industrial farms did have over smaller producers were of another kind.

What they gave away in agility and quality labor they often made up for in their considerable political and economic clout. <strong>— 198: 3689-3693</strong></p>
