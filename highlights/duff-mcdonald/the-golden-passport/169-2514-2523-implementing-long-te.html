<h1>The Golden Passport</h1>

<p>implementing long-term policies. In Chester Barnard, the folks at HBS found the exact thing they’d been looking for: a real-life executive who validated their ideas about enlightened management. But in the wrong hands—which included, it would seem, his own—all Barnard’s particular approach to human relations did was replace autocracy with paternalism. And in doing so, he helped lay the foundations of an insidious cult of moral leadership that we are still grappling with today. By making the case that success is a result of moral purity—and that corporate leadership is intrinsically moral—he left us not just with the dangers of false pride but with something worse, which James Hoopes refers to as the paradox of moral leadership. “Only those who recognize that they may be or become morally unfit to lead are morally worthy to do so,” writes Hoopes in Hail to the CEO: The Failure of George W. Bush and the Cult of Moral Leadership. “People confident of their purity are morally unqualified to lead.” HBS only compounds the issue by insisting to new students that they are already America’s future leaders simply by virtue of having enrolled. <strong>— 169: 2514-2523</strong></p>
