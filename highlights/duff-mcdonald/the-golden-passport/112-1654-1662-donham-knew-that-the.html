<h1>The Golden Passport</h1>

<p>Donham knew that the whole “science of business” was a feint, and that the real point was rhetoric, the purpose of a business school to produce people who could walk the walk and talk the talk of management in an exploding economic situation. The essence of rhetoric is to mess with people’s heads—that’s why we’ve been interested in it for three thousand years, and it’s also why it was such a natural fit with business. (Of course, the majority of modern business school professors are nowhere near reflexive enough to realize that they work for schools of rhetoric.) When it adopted the Socratic method as its primary form of teaching, one can only hope that HBS was aware of—and perhaps even extra-sensitive to—Socrates’s warning that unless it is accompanied by a guiding moral philosophy, rhetoric is mere flattery used to persuade for personal gain. Or maybe they weren’t. In any case, the rhetoric has been there from the very start. The moral philosophy? Not so much. Management historian J.-C. <strong>— 112: 1654-1662</strong></p>
