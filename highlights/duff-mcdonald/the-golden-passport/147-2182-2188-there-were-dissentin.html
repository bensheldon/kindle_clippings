<h1>The Golden Passport</h1>

<p>There were dissenting opinions, of course. In The Higher Learning in America, Thorstein Veblen ventured the opinion that the speed of one’s climb was irrelevant, because the learning curve was actually a road to nowhere: “No gain comes to the community at large from increasing the business proficiency of any number of its young men. There are already much too many of these businessmen, much too astute and proficient in their calling, for the common good. A higher average business efficiency simply raises activity and avidity in business to a higher average pitch of skill and fervor, with very little other material result than a redistribution of ownership; since business is occupied with the competitive acquisition of wealth, not with its production.”4 <strong>— 147: 2182-2188</strong></p>
