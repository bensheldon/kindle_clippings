<h1>The Fires: How a Computer Formula, Big Ideas, and the Best of Intentions Burned Down New Yo rk City--and Determined the Future of Cities</h1>

<p>The root approach is, of course, necessary for the kinds of large-scale projects that big cities often need—no one was going to take part in a decentralized, uncoordinated effort to dig the Erie Canal or fill in the marsh that is now Boston’s Back Bay. The trouble with the root approach is that it’s extremely vulnerable to bad ideas. Given the hasty, often unexamined nature of the branch approach, bad ideas are perhaps more common than with the comprehensive planning of the root approach—just think of the number of businesses that open on the wrong block, only to close up shop shortly thereafter. But there’s a safety mechanism in that failure: the shop owner sees the error of his ways and closes before he wastes even more time and money. Because the root approach presumes to have considered all possible options before proceeding, there is no equivalent rethinking, and bad ideas are given a much longer life-span. <strong>— : 1934</strong></p>
