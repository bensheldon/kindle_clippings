<h1>The Fires: How a Computer Formula, Big Ideas, and the Best of Intentions Burned Down New Yo rk City--and Determined the Future of Cities</h1>

<p>In the “old days” of Tammany-style governance, O’Hagan and RAND’s big ideas and ambitious reform agenda wouldn’t have mattered much. Local ward bosses, irate at watching their constituents being burned out of their homes, would have drawn together the relevant authorities and cobbled together a plan. In all likelihood, fire patrols and building inspections would have been increased, negligent landlords brought into line, redlining dogmas put aside to make loans available, renovation and poverty programs put in place, fire-awareness campaigns begun—in other words, exactly the kinds of things Chief Kirby was recommending. Such plans would have been classic Tammany pluralism—true branch-approach problem-solving. The programs would be hastily assembled and muddled through by trial and error. Some would succeed, others fail, and most would be rife with backdoor politicking and corruption. It wouldn’t have been particularly analytic, scientific, transparent, or progressive, but something would have been done, and done quickly. There were too many buildings, votes, and dollars being lost. <strong>— : 2670</strong></p>
