<h1>The Fires: How a Computer Formula, Big Ideas, and the Best of Intentions Burned Down New Yo rk City--and Determined the Future of Cities</h1>

<p>tradition and intuition. The old ways of doing business certainly had their irrationalities and shortcomings. But in the quest to rationalize and centralize from the top down, to focus on the big picture and the comprehensive plan, the realities of a bottom-up jury-rigged city had fallen through the cracks. Just as neighborhoods consumed by flame were pushed to the side by the city and the department responsible for protecting them, so too were the lessons to be learned in those neighborhoods. Like the War Years themselves, the Waldbaum’s collapse was a presumed act of arson that turned out to be caused by big ideas, misaligned priorities, and the lost lessons of the Bronx. <strong>— : 3761</strong></p>
