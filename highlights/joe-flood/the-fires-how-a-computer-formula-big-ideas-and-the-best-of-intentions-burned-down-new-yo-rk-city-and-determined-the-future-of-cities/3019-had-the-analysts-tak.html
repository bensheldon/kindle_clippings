<h1>The Fires: How a Computer Formula, Big Ideas, and the Best of Intentions Burned Down New Yo rk City--and Determined the Future of Cities</h1>

<p>Had the analysts taken a step back from the models, perhaps they would have thought there was something fishy about closing companies in the most fire-prone neighborhoods in the country and opening them in Staten Island. But lost in a modeler’s world that was increasingly divorced from reality, the fire project had “stepped through the looking glass,” as RAND physicist Sam Cohen once said of his colleagues who worked on systems analysis, “where people did the weirdest things and [used] the most perverse kind of logic imaginable and yet claimed to have the most precise understanding of everything . . . because it all sounded so damn rational and so damn reasonable as to be unassailable.” <strong>— : 3019</strong></p>
