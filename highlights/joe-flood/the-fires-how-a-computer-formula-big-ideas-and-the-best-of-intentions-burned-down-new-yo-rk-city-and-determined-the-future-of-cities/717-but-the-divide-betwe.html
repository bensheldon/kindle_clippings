<h1>The Fires: How a Computer Formula, Big Ideas, and the Best of Intentions Burned Down New Yo rk City--and Determined the Future of Cities</h1>

<p>But the divide between reformers and the machine went beyond the simple question of which social classes and ethnic groups would be in charge to a deeper disagreement over the basic philosophy of government. At its best, Tammany was an exemplar of what political scientist Charles Lindblom would call the “branch” approach to decision-making: an incremental, usually decentralized and bottom-up process of “continually building out from the current situation, step-by-step and by small degrees.” Nearly every major aspect of New York City—its economy, population, ethnic mix, real estate market, transportation, and public health system—was in a constant state of flux, and Tammany’s job was to stay out of the way when possible, provide services and deal with crises when needed, and remain flexible and responsive enough to keep the votes coming, practitioners of what Lindblom called “the science of muddling through.” Educated reformers, on the other hand, tended to favor what Lindblom called the “root” approach to decision-making: comprehensively analyzing a situation, determining the ideal course of action, and then charging forward with it, a generally centralized, top-down process of “starting from fundamentals anew each time, building on the past only as experience is embodied in a theory, and always prepared to start completely from the ground up.” There are merits to both approaches, but the two sides were rarely comprehensible to one another, root-approach reformers seeing the machine’s branch approach as cynical, plodding, and wasteful (not to mention corrupt) and the pragmatic Tammany chieftains writing the good-government types off as starry-eyed dilettantes too concerned with simplistic theories of what government and society should be to deal with the complicated realities of what the city itself actually was. <strong>— : 717</strong></p>
