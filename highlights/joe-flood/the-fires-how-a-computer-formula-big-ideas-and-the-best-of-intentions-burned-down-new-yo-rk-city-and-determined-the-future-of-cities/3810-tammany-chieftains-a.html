<h1>The Fires: How a Computer Formula, Big Ideas, and the Best of Intentions Burned Down New Yo rk City--and Determined the Future of Cities</h1>

<p>Tammany chieftains and ward bosses didn’t pretend to know what was best for individual precincts or neighborhoods on the basis of some statistical measurement. They were more ploddingly reactive, letting constituents come to them with new ideas for improving things and backing the ideas that seemed most credible or were the easiest to drum up support for. Intrinsically connected to the street, machine bosses had no time for abstract notions of how impoverished immigrants should be housed or fed or educated; they were forced to contend with the problems of the slums as they were. After all, stray too far from reality and someone with a better sense of what voters wanted would up and take your place. <strong>— : 3810</strong></p>
