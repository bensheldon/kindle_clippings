<h1>The Field Guide to Understanding 'Human Error'</h1>

<p>The move away from punishing good technicians for maintenance errors began about two decades ago as leaders began to understand the downside of disciplining to ‘fix’ errors—and the upside of instead conducting a thorough evaluation of the ‘why’ behind those errors. Even repetitive errors are usually the result of something other than a technician’s negligence. A striking example of this occurred when, over a six-year period, ‘hundreds of mechanics were cited for logbook violations. People working the aircraft on the gate were under pressure and they’d screw up the paperwork.’ Violations meant suspensions or a fine. Then the airline wanted to print 50,000 new logbooks. Starting with the station that had most problems, it asked the mechanics to design the pages. They did. Another station made a few tweaks, and when the new logbooks were introduced, violations dropped to zero. The problem wasn’t negligent mechanics, it was a poorly designed logbook. <strong>— 19: 772-780</strong></p>
