<h1>The Field Guide to Understanding 'Human Error'</h1>

<p>Put second victim support in place. Second victims are practitioners who have been involved in an incident that (potentially) hurt or killed someone else (for example, passengers, bystanders) and for which they feel personally responsible. Strong social and organizational support systems for second victims (psychological first aid, debriefings, follow-up), have proven critical to contain the negative consequences (particularly post-traumatic stress in all its forms). Implementing and maintaining support systems takes resources, but it is an investment not only in worker health and retention—it is an investment in justice and safety too. Justice can come from acknowledging that the practitioner is a victim too—a second victim. For some it can be empowering to be part of an investigation process. The opportunity to recount experiences first-hand can be healing—if these are taken seriously and do not expose the second victim to potential retribution or other forms of jeopardy. Such involvement of second victims is an important organizational investment in safety and learning. The resilience of second victims and the organization are intricately intertwined, after all. The lived experience of a second victim represents a rich trove of data for how safety is made and broken at the very heart of the organization. Those accounts can be integrated in how an individual and an organization handle their risk and safety. <strong>— 24: 866-877</strong></p>
