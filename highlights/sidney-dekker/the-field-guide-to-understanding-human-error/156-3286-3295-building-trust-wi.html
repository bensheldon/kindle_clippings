<h1>The Field Guide to Understanding 'Human Error'</h1>

<p>• building trust, with a comfort about being vulnerable and honest with each other when it comes to weaknesses or mistakes; • comfortable with what is known as constructive conflict, a willingness to engage in passionate dialogue about what matters to the team. There is no hesitation to disagree, challenge and question—all in the spirit of finding the best answer or solution for that context; • a decision process where people can participate and which they feel is something they have contributed to. Even if the outcome is not what they might have wanted, they still agreed to the process, and so will be more ready to offer the buy-in that the team needs; • shared accountability after having committed to decisions and standards of performance. The team leader does not have to be the primary source of such accountability, peers do it instead. Such accountability is typically forward-looking, not backward-looking; • a focus on results that allows individual agendas and needs to be set aside. <strong>— 156: 3286-3295</strong></p>
