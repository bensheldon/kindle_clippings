<h1>The Linguistics Wars</h1>

<p>“For base men,” Empedocles warns us, “it is indeed possible to withhold belief from strong proofs” (fragment 55), but baseness, like beauty and contact lenses, is in the eye of the beholder. When scientists across the way refuse to grant the force of an argument that its sponsor finds compelling, they are base by definition, which is why the most common accusations in science are forms of ad hominems—implications of personal failings, like stupidity, sloppy scholarship, and often, dishonesty. Personal attacks are far more common in science than is generally thought (suggesting, among other things, that thin veils such as x is confused, or y fails to understand the issue, or z misrepresents my position actually work). Even the parched and stolid pages of professional journals are full of them, and they cluster fructiferously around paradigm disputes. It isn’t difficult to see why. Most immediately, mudslinging is easy. If you find an observation disagreeable, says Hawking, “you can always question the competence of the person who carried the observation out” (1988:10). <strong>— 160: 4165-4173</strong></p>
