<h1>The Government-Citizen Disconnect</h1>

<p>Ironically, the policies associated with some impact on broader views about government are those that tend to be the most stigmatized and in which government’s role as a provider may be most evident—the visible means-tested policies. Repeated usage of these policies conveyed to recipients that government made a positive difference in their lives. Yet, beyond that, multiple uses of neither visible nor submerged policies appeared to have any bearing on enhanced attitudes about government. In the case of the means-tested variant of submerged policies, moreover, accumulated usage failed to mitigate more negative views of government, leaving recipients more resentful than others and assured only that they pay a fair amount of taxes. In sum, despite the considerable resources committed to each of these policy types, with modest exceptions, the impact of policy usage on citizens’ perceptions appears to evaporate, at least over the long term. Specific policies may make a difference in attitudes, as some studies have shown, but accumulated memories of policy usage seem to exert little bearing on broad attitudes about government. <strong>— 148: 2040-2048</strong></p>
