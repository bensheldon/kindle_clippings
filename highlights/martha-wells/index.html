<h1>Martha Wells</h1>


  <h2>The Book of Ile-Rien</h2>

<ul>
  
    <li><p>Her real talent was for acting, and the roles she played in pursuit of Nicholas’s goals were just as thrilling as lead ingénue at the Elegante. <strong>— : file:///mnt/onboard/Wells, Martha/Book of Ile-Rien, The - Martha Wells.epub#(31)text/part0032.html</strong></p>
</li>

</li>
  
</ul>


  <h2>Edge of Worlds</h2>

<ul>
  
    <li><p>One thing Moon had figured out since joining the court was that being the one who pointed out what things were wrong was relatively easy compared to being the one who had to decide what to do about them. <strong>— : /mnt/onboard/Wells, Martha/Edge of Worlds - Martha Wells.kepub.epub!OEBPS!Text/ch03.html</strong></p>
