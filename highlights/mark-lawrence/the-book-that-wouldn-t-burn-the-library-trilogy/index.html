<h2>The Book That Wouldn't Burn (The Library Trilogy)</h2>

<ul>
  
    <li><p>Salamonda creaked away down the stairs, leaving her alone. Livira stood, tingling with an emotion she only half recognised. Kindness carries a weight; it’s a burden all its own when you have nothing. Some undeniable part of Livira wanted to bite the hands that offered so much so freely. Pride is stupid, pride is blind, but pride is also the backbone that runs through us: without pride there’s no spring-back, no resilience. Malar had been precise with his kindness as only those who’ve been hurt and humbled themselves can be. Livira’s lips were bruised where the back of his hand had caught her, but it was a different quality of sting to the one that ran through the salvation Yute offered. There would be a weight to these dresses that she hadn’t felt beneath Malar’s best cloak. And though the soldier could probably never explain all that, Livira felt that in his bones he understood it. <strong>— : file:///mnt/onboard/Lawrence, Mark/Book That Wouldn_t Burn (The Library Trilogy), The - Mark Lawrence.epub#(15)text/part0015_split_000.html#x9780593437933_EPUB-14</strong></p>
