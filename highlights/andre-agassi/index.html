  <h2>Open</h2>

<ul>
  
    <li><p>I talk about my father. I tell J.P. about the yelling, the pressure, the rage, the abandonment. J.P. gets a funny look on his face. You do realize, don’t you, that God isn’t anything like your father? You know that—don’t you? I almost drive the Corvette onto the shoulder. God, he says, is the opposite of your father. God isn’t mad at you all the time. God isn’t yelling in your ear, harping on your imperfections. That voice you hear all the time, that angry voice? That’s not God. That’s still your father. I turn to him: Do me a favor? Say that again. He does. Word for word. Say it once more. He does. I thank him. I ask about his own life. <strong>— 148: 2164-2170</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>Andre, I won’t ever try to change you, because I’ve never tried to change anybody. If I could change somebody, I’d change myself. But I know I can give you structure and a blueprint to achieve what you want. There’s a difference between a plow horse and a racehorse. You don’t treat them the same. You hear all this talk about treating people equally, and I’m not sure equal means the same. As far as I’m concerned, you’re a racehorse, and I’ll always treat you accordingly. I’ll be firm, but fair. I’ll lead, never push. I’m not one of those people who expresses or articulates feelings very well, but from now on, just know this: It’s on, man. It is on. You know what I’m saying? We’re in a fight, and you can count on me until the last man is standing. Somewhere up there is a star with your name on it. I might not be able to help you find it, but I’ve got pretty strong shoulders, and you can stand on my shoulders while you’re looking for that star. You hear? For as long as you want. Stand on my shoulders and reach, man. Reach. <strong>— 177: 2594-2601</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>It couldn’t work, no matter how long the match, because you can’t win the final of a slam by playing not to lose, or waiting for your opponent to lose <strong>— 181: 2650-2651</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>Few of us are granted the grace to know ourselves, and until we do, maybe the best we can do is be consistent. My father is nothing if not consistent. <strong>— 243: 3557-3558</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>played, and the most draining. I tell myself <strong>— 441: 6505-6505</strong></p>
</li>
  
</ul>
