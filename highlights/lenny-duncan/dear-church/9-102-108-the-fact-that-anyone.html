<h1>Dear Church</h1>

<p>The fact that anyone among us feels like we should apologize is heartbreaking to me. Let me be clear, the church should be all about bringing people further and further along the arc toward justice. But the work of bringing congregations along this journey is difficult, and leadership isn’t about blindly walking into the future. An elder in the black Lutheran community once said, “If you are a leader in this church and no one is following, you are just out for a walk.” We must meet our communities where they are, but the God of Jesus of Nazareth has never shied away from the proclamation of truth. The gospel is always a call for liberation. It infects the hearts of those it has been presented to like wildfire that scorches away hatred. When did we become so damn afraid of it? Dear Church, we are cowards. <strong>— 9: 102-108</strong></p>
