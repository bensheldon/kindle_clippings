<h1>Eleven Rings</h1>

<p>This calling is not unlike the traditional Christian concept of living in grace. In October I went to a panel discussion on the ascetic life at Loyola Marymount College led by a friend, author Kathleen Norris. She told a story about a monk in the Middle Ages who traveled to a nearby city to visit a famous ascetic who turned out to be a merchant living in a busy market district. That night, while they were praying, the monk was rattled by the noise some drunks and prostitutes were making in the street and asked the merchant “How on earth can you stand this every night?” The merchant replied, “I just say to myself, ‘They’re all going to the kingdom.’” Kathleen, who is a devout Christian, told this story because she often uses it in her own practice. Once when she was staying in a private club in Chicago, the man next door came back to his room with a call girl and they started making an unholy racket. “I had to make a choice between being disturbed or not disturbed,” she said. “Then I remembered this story and just said to myself, ‘We’re all going to the kingdom.’” <strong>— 315: 4554-4562</strong></p>
