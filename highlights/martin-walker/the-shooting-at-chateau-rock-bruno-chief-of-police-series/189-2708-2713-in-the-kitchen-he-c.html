<h1>The Shooting at Chateau Rock (Bruno, Chief of Police Series)</h1>

<p>In the kitchen, he chopped two shallots and three cloves of garlic. He seasoned the chicken thighs with salt and pepper and took some of his homemade duck stock from his fridge. In the garden, he picked a handful of fresh tarragon, put some to one side for garnish and chopped the remainder. In a casserole dish he began gently to sauté the shallots in butter. Once they were soft, he added the garlic and the chopped tarragon, a generous wineglass of the stock and a less generous glass of dry white wine and brought it to a low simmer. Then he put the lid onto the pot and put it into the oven on high heat for fifteen minutes, then lowered the heat to medium. Another forty minutes and the chicken would be just right. <strong>— 189: 2708-2713</strong></p>
