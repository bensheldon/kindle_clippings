<h1>White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism</h1>

<p>ASSUMPTIONS • Racism is simply personal prejudice. • I am free of racism. • I will be the judge of whether racism has occurred. • My learning is finished; I know all I need to know. • Racism can only be intentional; my not having intended racism cancels out the impact of my behavior. • My suffering relieves me of racism or racial privilege. • White people who experience another form of oppression cannot experience racial privilege. • If I am a good person, I can’t be racist. • I am entitled to remain comfortable/have this conversation the way I want to. • How I am perceived by others is the most important issue. • As a white person, I know the best way to challenge racism. • If I am feeling challenged, you are doing this wrong. • It’s unkind to point out racism. • Racism is conscious bias. I have none, so I am not racist. • Racists are bad individuals, so you are saying that I am a bad person. • If you knew me or understood me, you would know I can’t be racist. • I have friends of color, so I can’t be racist. • There is no problem; society is fine the way it is. • Racism is a simple problem. People just need to . . . • My worldview is objective and the only one operating. • If I can’t see it, it isn’t legitimate. • If you have more knowledge on the subject than I do, you think you’re better than me. <strong>— 121: 2100-2119</strong></p>
