<h1>Lost in Math</h1>

<p>“It goes back to this book by Richard Dawid, who started his career in physics but then turned to philosophy.” According to Richard, I explain, it is rational of string theorists to take into account all available information, including mathematical properties, to evaluate their theory. “But what’s the point of such a theory if it doesn’t explain anything?” Frank asks. “Richard is silent on this issue.” “Well, let me put it this way. If there was any bit of experimental evidence that was decisive and in favor of the theory, you wouldn’t be hearing these arguments. You wouldn’t. Nobody would care. It’s just a fallback. It’s giving up and declaring victory. I don’t like that at all.” Yes, I think, the discussion about post-empirical arguments was brought on by lack of empirical arguments. But simply knowing that doesn’t move us forward. <strong>— 167: 2384-2391</strong></p>
