<h1>Getting to the Bottom of Top: Foundations of the Methodologies of the Technology of Participation</h1>

<p>In Western society, we struggle with articulating the reflective level. Reducing the reflective level questions to “How did this make you feel?” generates very little information, and many people avoid answering. More useful and appropriate information is elicited with several more specific questions, such as “What part of this made you uncomfortable, and which part were you pleased with?” Questions that elicit memories or past experiences can also be very helpful in allowing people to pay attention to their inner experience. The most successful interpretive questions are specifically crafted to explore insights in relation to the aim of the conversation. For example, if the aim is to understand a policy, one interpretive question may be “What implications might this policy have for our daily work?” Decisional level questions also work best when they are specific to the aim of the conversation. Sometimes a group decision is necessary, so articulating it is useful: “What have we decided to do?” Sometimes individual decisions are important: “What will you do next to apply what you’ve learned today?” Sometimes both are needed. Leaving the room without any decisional question will leave the group hanging and unsatisfied. If a decision is not possible, deciding not to decide and when to come back to the topic can be sufficient. After <strong>— 82: 1203-1213</strong></p>
