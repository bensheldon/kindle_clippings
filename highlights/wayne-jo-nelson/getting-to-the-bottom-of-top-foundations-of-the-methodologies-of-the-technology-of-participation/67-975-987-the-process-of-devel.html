<h1>Getting to the Bottom of Top: Foundations of the Methodologies of the Technology of Participation</h1>

<p>The process of development and the formation of developmental strategy is a complex, interrelated whole that contains specific and very real polarities. At the most general level, there is a tension between the group’s vision for the future and the complex of factors that negate the vision or hinder its fulfillment. Seeing the specific barriers in relation to a vision enables a group to see their whole strategic situation and identify key underlying contradictions that must be addressed if they are to realize their vision. Naming those contradictions provides a platform for strategic thinking. This analysis provides insight into steps and strategic directions that can be taken to address the group’s situation in an authentic, future-oriented way. When they have identified their strategies, the group can create specific, practical action plans to implement their chosen strategies. This process has become known as the ToP Strategic Planning Method. ToP action planning rounds out the basic suite of ToP applications. The core of this method includes identifying a desired future state, analyzing the hindering and supporting factors in the present situation, naming concrete commitments given the present reality, generating actions toward those commitments, and timelining the actions with assignments and estimated costs. The ToP journey wall applies the charting approach to time and historical events to enable a group to look at, discuss, create a story of their journey, and learn from their past experience. <strong>— 67: 975-987</strong></p>
