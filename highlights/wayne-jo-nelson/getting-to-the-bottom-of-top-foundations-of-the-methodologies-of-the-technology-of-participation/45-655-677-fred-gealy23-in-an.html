<h1>Getting to the Bottom of Top: Foundations of the Methodologies of the Technology of Participation</h1>

<p>Fred Gealy23, in an essay called “Encounter and Dialogue”, suggests we begin our dialogue with sacred literature by first asking what the writer actually says, allowing authors to speak for themselves rather than beginning with our beliefs, assumptions or someone else’s interpretation. We let them “have their say.” We look for the actual words and phrases themselves. He then says we need to ask what happened in the story, because much of the world’s sacred literature takes a narrative form. We break out the steps taken and find the elements of a given story or passage. What were the events? He calls them “happenednesses.” He asks us to look at the historical, economic, political, social and cultural context. What was really going on? We find the objective occurrences and set them in context. We isolate and identify the human dynamics in the story. His next step suggests that we ask our own questions. In light of what happened in the stories, we surface the questions that are raised in our own very real lives today, the “existential questions” that strike deep into the core of our beings and raise foundational questions about our very nature. These are the questions that do not go away. They trigger an inquiry or a search for the answers that will enable us to consciously shape our lives. We draw relationships between the happenednesses and our own situation. It is easy to see this as two distinct steps: 1) a reflective self-examination, followed by 2) relating our own life experience to the story. It is only then, Gealy says, that it is appropriate to ask about the message we take from the story or text. How does it impact me in my real situation? How do I come up with answers to the questions I face? How do I determine my sense of identity and purpose? It is these pressing questions that focus the message and make it personal. It is the answers that provide a framework for authentic meaning and significance for each person. Gealy’s insights into applied phenomenology gave rise to ICA’s methods, first as study and teaching methodologies and later as the ToP facilitation methodologies. As they evolved, they were applied to all kinds of challenges in organisations and communities. The technology in the Technology of Participation (ToP) is the phenomenological method.   Phenomenology as method   Combining the methods used in demythologizing with insights from Suzanne Langer24, Gealy and others led to the creation of a unique approach to phenomenological inquiry. <strong>— 45: 655-677</strong></p>
