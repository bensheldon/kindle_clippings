<h2>Getting to the Bottom of Top: Foundations of the Methodologies of the Technology of Participation</h2>

<ul>
  
    <li><p>ToP methods of facilitating participation are much more than a neat way to get meetings to go somewhere. They aim to build off the deep undercurrents of history, deal with some major contradictions of our day, create a new paradigm of participation, and bring about profound transformations in people and society. <strong>— 11: 136-138</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>The ToP methods are based on what can be called a trans-establishment stance. While acknowledging the necessity of both the establishment (the tradition) and disestablishment (loyal opposition) in society, and while participating in either of these dynamics from time to time, those who belong to the trans-establishment don’t identify with either one. They operate as if there were no enemies; they see everyone as potential allies in building the future. <strong>— 20: 274-278</strong></p>

    <li><p>Finally, the intent of ICA is to put the tools for participation in the hands of everyone, and enable anyone in any situation to be equipped to put on the mantle of leadership in order to lead a group to a new place, or an organization in a new direction. It is not much of an exaggeration to say that these methods are intended to put consultants out of a job. <strong>— 21: 290-292</strong></p>
</li>
  
    <li><p>When we are involved in an inquiry, assumptions, judgments, theories, presuppositions, beliefs, ready-made interpretations, and solutions are all set aside in order to focus on the object of the inquiry itself without interference. When we suspend our assumptions and judgments, we move closer to the reality itself and are able to make much more direct contact with our experience. When we objectify our feelings, preferences and expectations about something, we can observe our relationship to a concern as it is, rather than as we think it should be. We become open to our own reality. <strong>— 28: 398-402</strong></p>

    <li><p>To live humanly is to be in a crisis of decision at every moment. The always-present capacity for <strong>— 43: 620-621</strong></p>
