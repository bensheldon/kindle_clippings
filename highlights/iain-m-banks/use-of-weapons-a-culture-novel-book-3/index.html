<h2>Use of Weapons (A Culture Novel Book 3)</h2>

<ul>
  
    <li><p>Then the boat split apart, and he dropped through it, through the water underneath, then splashed out of the underside of the water, into air again, and saw the ocean beneath him, and a tiny speck of its surface, which he was falling toward. It was another small boat; he crashed through it, through more water, through more air, through the wreckage of a boat, through another layer of water and another level of air . . . -Hey — one part of his mind thought as he fell — this is like how Sma described the Reality. . . . splashed through more waves, through the water, out into air, heading for more waves . . . This wasn’t going to stop. He remembered that the Reality Sma had described was expanding all the time; you could fall through forever; really forever, not until the end of the universe; literally forever. That won’t do, he thought to himself. He’d have to face the ship. He landed in a little creaking, leaking boat. <strong>— : 1592</strong></p>

    <li><p>It was a long time later he found out he’d taken the Chosen to the Palace only because the brat was to be the last of the line. Not merely stupid, but also impotent, the Chosen fathered no strong sons and no cunning daughters (as the Culture had known all along), and the fractious desert tribes swept in a de-cade later led by a Matriarch who had guided most of the warriors under her command through the dream-leaf time, and had seen one stronger and stranger than all of them suffer its effects and come through unscathed but still unfulfilled, and known through that very experience that there was more to their desert existence than had been guessed at by the myths and elders of her nomad tribe. <strong>— : 4008</strong></p>
