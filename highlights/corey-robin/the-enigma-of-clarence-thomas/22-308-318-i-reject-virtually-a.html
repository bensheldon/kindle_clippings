<h1>The Enigma of Clarence Thomas</h1>

<p>I reject virtually all of Thomas’s views. In presenting his vision, however, I’ve opted for interpretation and analysis rather than objection and critique. I’ve included dissenting voices—either my own or those of other justices or analysts in the media and academe—only when they amplify lines of argument or assumption in Thomas’s jurisprudence that might otherwise be inaudible. As a longtime reader of the right from the left, I know how tempting it is for people on one side of the spectrum to dismiss those on the other as unthinking defenders of partisan advantage. Because the temptation to dismiss is even greater in Thomas’s case—perversely mimicking the dismissal of Marshall—and because it’s sufficiently difficult to get people to believe that Thomas has a jurisprudence, much less to hear it, the imperative to let him speak without the interruption of easy criticisms is that much more acute. Thomas’s is a voice that unsettles. His beliefs are disturbing, even ugly; his style is brutal. I want to make us sit with that discomfort rather than swat it away. This is not so that we adopt Thomas’s views, but so we see the world through his eyes—and realize, perhaps to our surprise, that his vision is in some ways similar to our own. Which should unsettle us even more. <strong>— 22: 308-318</strong></p>
