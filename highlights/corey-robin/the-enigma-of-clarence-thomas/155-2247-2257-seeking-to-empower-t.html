<h1>The Enigma of Clarence Thomas</h1>

<p>Seeking to empower the federal government to override state regulations, to bring together the separate and discrete economies of the states into a single, integrated national economy—much the way the European Union is now doing for the separate economies of the continent’s nation-states—Marshall argued for a broad interpretation of the Commerce Clause.48 Commerce should be understood not in limited terms, he said, as only the buying and selling of goods, but as a social activity that transcends simple business transactions. “Intercourse,” Marshall called it, invoking an eighteenth-century conception, popular among the Framers, of commerce as interactions between diverse people across the globe. Commerce was a way of being social, of living with others in a single civilization; it was a dialogue among strangers. Among the definitions of commerce cited in Samuel Johnson’s Dictionary was “interchange of anything.”49 That “anything” could be commodities, texts, or opinions. Any proper reading of the term would include a great many activities beyond the buying and selling of goods. <strong>— 155: 2247-2257</strong></p>
