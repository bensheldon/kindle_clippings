<h1>The Enigma of Clarence Thomas</h1>

<p>THOMAS’S CLAIM THAT the state cannot do anything for African Americans seems at odds with his claim that the state will make things worse for African Americans. Such contradiction is not his alone. As Hirschman points out, conservatives often invoke two other theses, in addition to futility, against reformist or radical political action. One is the “perversity thesis,” which holds that “the attempt to push society in a certain direction will result in its moving … in the opposite direction”: “any purposive action to improve some feature of the political, social, or economic order only serves to exacerbate the condition one wishes to remedy.” The other is the “jeopardy thesis,” which holds that “the cost of the proposed change or reform is too high as it endangers some previous, precious accomplishment.” Unlike the futility thesis, the theses of perversity and jeopardy assume that state action can have an impact, albeit a negative one. Though making a simultaneous case for futility and perversity, or futility and jeopardy, seems like a challenge—affirming the state’s potency and impotence in the same breath—an agonized conscience of consistency does not seem to trouble opponents of political transformation. Whenever futilitarians are not “quite comfortable with their own argument,” says Hirschman, “they look to the perverse effect for reinforcement, adornment, and closure.”30 That is certainly the case with Thomas’s dissent in Kelo v. City of New London (2005), which used arguments of both perversity and jeopardy to oppose state projects of social reform. <strong>— 145: 2110-2123</strong></p>
