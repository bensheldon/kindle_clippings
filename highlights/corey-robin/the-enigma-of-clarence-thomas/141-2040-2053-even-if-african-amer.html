<h1>The Enigma of Clarence Thomas</h1>

<p>EVEN IF AFRICAN Americans achieve power in the electoral realm, Thomas says, the state cannot deliver the transformation they seek. The disparity between the extent of black problems and the paucity of liberal solutions is too great. This claim of Thomas’s follows the conservative logic of what social theorist Albert Hirschman calls “the futility thesis,” which holds that any political attempt to alter a specific social condition will be “largely surface, façade, cosmetic, hence illusory, as the ‘deep’ structures of society remain wholly untouched.” As Hirschman points out, futilitarian arguments on the right often resemble structural arguments on the left. The latter are meant to portray reformist efforts as insufficiently radical, mere salves to social wounds that cannot be healed without a revolutionary transformation. It’s no surprise, then, that Thomas’s critique on the Court sounds similar to the critiques he deployed as a younger man. The difference is that the claim from the right is made not on behalf of a change that has yet to occur but against a change that already has been tried.18 The futility thesis preys upon the disappointment that so often comes in the wake of a large effort, the feeling that the change is not great enough, the transformation not deep enough, to justify all the sacrifice that went into its making. As we’ve seen, Thomas’s conservative critique also speaks to the pervasive sense that nothing much was achieved through the black freedom struggle. The disrepair was—is—too great for the state to fix. <strong>— 141: 2040-2053</strong></p>
