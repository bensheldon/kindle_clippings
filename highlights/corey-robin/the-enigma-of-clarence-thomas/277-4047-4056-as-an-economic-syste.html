<h1>The Enigma of Clarence Thomas</h1>

<p>As an economic system, capitalism may entail restless dynamism and creative destruction, but its role in our polity is anything but creative or dynamic. The business of capitalism is to take the great questions of society—justice, equality, freedom, distribution—off the table of public deliberation. Capitalism’s most ardent proponents say that it functions best when it is untouched by democracy, when it is protected from the conscious and collective interference of citizens acting through their government. And while for a brief stretch of the twentieth century the Constitution was envisioned as a living experiment, a text to be revised and revisited through argument and amendment, its function today is the opposite. Through the Senate and the Electoral College, both of which privilege the interests of a numerical minority from mostly white states over the interests of democratic, multiracial majorities; through the elevation of the Supreme Court to the status of talisman, where the fate of the nation hinges on nine men and women educated at the most elite schools; and through the doctrine of originalism, the Constitution has reverted to what it has been throughout most of American history: a source of overwhelming, anti-democratic constraint. <strong>— 277: 4047-4056</strong></p>
