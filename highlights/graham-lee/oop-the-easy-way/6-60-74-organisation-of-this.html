<h1>OOP the Easy Way</h1>

<p>Organisation of this book There are three parts to this story. The first, and necessarily the longest, antithesis: a deconstruction of the state of OOP as it exists today. To get to the kernel of a good idea, you have to crack a few nuts. Part one is the agitation that necessarily precedes revolution. The second part, thesis: a reconstruction of OOP using only the parts that were left over after the antithesis. Part two is the manifesto: once we’ve seen that the last few decades of status quo haven’t been working for us, we can evaluate something that will. The third, synthesis: a discussion of the ideas from OOP that aren’t being provided by today’s object systems, and the ideas and problems that OOP doesn’t yet address at all. These are the next steps to take to pursue the ideas behind object thinking. Part three is the call to action. This is not a pure takedown, a suggestion that we have been monotonically doing it wrong for three decades: the antithesis part of this book questions, rejects and destroys a lot of built aspects of OOP, but by no means all of them. And by no means purely the later ones, either: the message is not that Smalltalk was created in some computational garden of Eden and that Sun tasted of the forbidden fruit which doomed us all to Java. Belief in a primaeval wisdom (urwissenheit) leads to an uncritical “tradition for tradition’s sake” in the same way that belief in primaeval stupidity (urdummheit) leads to an uncritical “novelty for novelty’s sake”. Rather this is an attempt to find a consistent philosophy, a way of thinking about software, and to find the threads in the narrative and dialectic history of the making of software that are supportive and unsupportive of that way of thinking. Because OOP is supposed to be a paradigm, a pattern of thought, and if we want to adopt that paradigm then we have to see how different tools or techniques support, damage, or modify our thoughts. <strong>— 6: 60-74</strong></p>
