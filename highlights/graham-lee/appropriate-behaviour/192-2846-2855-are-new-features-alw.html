<h1>APPropriate Behaviour</h1>

<p>Are new features always bigger and more expensive than bug fixes? No. Do bug fixes always cost us money, and never attract or protect income? No. Are new features sometimes snuck into maintenance? Yes. Are bug fixes sometimes held off until new project releases? Yes. Then why aren’t they budgeted together? It could be for ethical reasons: perhaps programmers feel that maintenance problems are mistakes they should own up to and correct free of charge. But remember that one of Lehman’s Laws says that the satisfaction derived from software will decay as the social environment involves. Not all bugs were bugs at the time of writing! You cannot be apologetic for work you did correctly before a change in the environment. To me, this suggests a need for a more nimble economic model, one that treats any change equally regardless of whether it’s a bug fix, feature addition or internal quality clean-up. Forget what we’ve already spent and made on this product (for that way lies the sunk cost fallacy), what will the proposed change cost? What will it get us? How risky is it? What else could we be doing instead? What alternatives do we have? <strong>— 192: 2846-2855</strong></p>
