<h1>APPropriate Behaviour</h1>

<p>you could say “here’s the problem as I see it, this is what we want to get out of solving it, and here is the solution”. Now your colleagues and partners are left in no doubt as to why you believe in the approach you present, and you’ve set a precedent for how they should present their views if they still disagree. The conversation can focus on the problems facing the project, not the imbeciles around the table. An aside on persuasion Framing an argument in this way is a well-known rhetorical technique. First people identify themselves as facing the problem you describe, so that when you describe the benefits of a solution your audience agrees that it would help. When you finally present your proposed solution, people already know that they want it. Nancy Duarte’s talk at TEDxEast goes into more depth on this theme. <strong>— 148: 2170-2178</strong></p>
