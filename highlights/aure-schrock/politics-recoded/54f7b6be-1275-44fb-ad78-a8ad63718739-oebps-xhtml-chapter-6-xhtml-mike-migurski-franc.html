<h1>Politics Recoded</h1>

<p>Mike Migurski, Frances Berriman, and the Chime team were “horizontalists” who advocated for a GDS-style play that would produce a durable “civic technology stack” that could be repurposed to serve different government needs. “Reject services, choose product,” reads a document, authored by members of the Chime team and publicly hosted on Google Docs, that summarized the need for an orientation toward platforms in manifesto-like language. “Code for America has been operating in a patronage model since 2010, and it’s time to stop,” they wrote, “we are too responsive to our funders’ desires and too dependent on nonprofit-style metrics reporting, and this harms our long-term credibility.” To isolate their work from the whims of funders, they proposed selling online platforms to government. A “product-oriented approach” would hypothetically allow CfA to produce and market “a common technology stack across partner governments.” Once the “full stack” platform existed, smaller “agile” efforts could be built on top of it. Creating a large platform and directing traffic to it was a familiar way that the private sector tech companies like Google and Facebook made money through advertisements. Had CfA gone down this route, it would resemble a tech corporation like Facebook or Twitter. The tech team used a similar framing as GDS and staff were already familiar with GDS-style of “digital transformation” projects. To them, a CMS like Chime was a necessary part of Code for America fulfilling its vision of Government as a Platform and a way to innovate by using fundamentals of software engineering to improve basic services—which the term referred to as “innobasics.”
Dave Guarino, Alan Williams, and others on the GetCalFresh project—which had been bootstrapped out of a Fellowship and run in extended demo mode for years—believed that Code for America should instead pursue “focus areas,” or thematically similar “verticals” that more directly improved residents’ lives. The first focus area (health and human services) was managed by Jack Madans, endorsed by Bob Sofman, and built on $175,000 received in 2015 from the California Health Care Foundation, which formed a foundation for GetCalFresh. Philosophically, the “vertical” faction were less attached to “product” than Migurski’s team. They instead believed in acquiring domain knowledge and using user-centered design principles to improve participation in government services. Their driving motivation was to reduce the harms that the neoliberal state imposed on citizens. It was quite a different approach to the vision of the “horizontalists,” who believed in engineering a general-purpose “full stack” platform for governance. The “vertical” effort also demanded a different funding strategy based on smaller, no-bid government contracts (which will be discussed shortly). The debate about how Code for America should become a technology company continued until Jennifer Pahlka returned from the federal government, where she served as Deputy Chief Technology Officer (CTO) from June 2013 to June 2014. <strong>— : 54f7b6be-1275-44fb-ad78-a8ad63718739!OEBPS!xhtml/chapter_6.xhtml</strong></p>
