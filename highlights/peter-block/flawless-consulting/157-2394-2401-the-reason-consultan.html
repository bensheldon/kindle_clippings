<h1>Flawless Consulting</h1>

<p>The reason consultants feel as if they are the victim of the resistance is that the client’s discomfort is being expressed indirectly. If the client were able to be authentic and put the concern directly into words by saying—”I am concerned I am losing control of this group,” or “I feel I am ill equipped to handle this particular situation,” or “People expect things from me that I just can’t deliver”—we consultants would not feel attacked. We would feel very supportive toward the manager. The manager’s direct expression of underlying concerns is not resistance. Resistance occurs only when the concerns about facing the difficult realities and the choice not to deal with them are expressed indirectly. They are expressed indirectly by blaming lack of detailed data, not enough time, impracticality, not enough budget, lack of understanding by “those people,” and so on, as the reasons not to proceed with a project or implement some recommendations. <strong>— 157: 2394-2401</strong></p>
