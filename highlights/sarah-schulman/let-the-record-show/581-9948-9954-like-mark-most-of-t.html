<h1>Let the Record Show</h1>

<p>Like Mark, most of the people I interviewed about the split mistakenly remembered “The Moratorium” as a halt on all meetings between ACT UP and the government. But, actually, by the time it came to the floor for a vote, it was a halt on all meetings about women without group approval. Technically, this would not have affected T&D because they were not meeting with the government about women, and in a sense, the proposal was a recognition of defeat by the people working on women-with-AIDS issues, trying to systematize some kind of control of their own territory. As often happens, reality is too complex, and a false but easier to remember version of a moratorium proposal as punitive and sprawling has substituted for the historical reality. <strong>— 581: 9948-9954</strong></p>
