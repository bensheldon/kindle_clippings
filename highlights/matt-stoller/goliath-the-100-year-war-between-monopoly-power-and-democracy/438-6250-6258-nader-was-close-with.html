<h1>Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</h1>

<p>Nader was close with Brandeis disciple Patman, working with Patman to oppose bailouts and supporting and advocating for the breakup of large firms such as General Motors.44 But unlike Brandeis, who had represented small firms and had experience in business, Nader’s career was not rooted in promoting fair commerce and protecting the citizen producer. Brandeis believed citizens needed control of production and commerce, so they could have the autonomy necessary to be citizens and protect their communities. Nader did not particularly care who had control of commerce as long as the consumer was protected.45 “People first had to get it that corporations were rapacious and government corrupt,” he said in 1975. The goal was to “replace corporations, break them up,” so they could be “owned by workers or better yet consumers.” In truth, Nader had not thought carefully about who would control commerce.46 <strong>— 438: 6250-6258</strong></p>
