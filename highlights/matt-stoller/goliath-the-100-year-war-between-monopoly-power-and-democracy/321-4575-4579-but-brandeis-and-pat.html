<h1>Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</h1>

<p>But Brandeis and Patman understood that political economy was about power structures. While Brandeis believed in science, he did not believe in overly applying technocratic tools to political decisions. Corporations and markets were engineered, and they could be structured to promote a free and self-governing people capable of making intelligent decisions about politics. But they could also become mechanisms of oppression. The forum for such discussions was that of law and politics, where human beings could use their liberties and free will to come together and make such decisions. <strong>â€” 321: 4575-4579</strong></p>
