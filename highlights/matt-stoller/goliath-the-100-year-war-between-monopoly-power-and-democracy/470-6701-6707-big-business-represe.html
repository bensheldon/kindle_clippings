<h1>Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</h1>

<p>Big business representatives had been attacking fair trade laws and the Robinson-Patman Act since the laws were passed. The laws aimed at two different price harms. The first was predation, where a corporation like Standard Oil or A&P could use discounting to drive competitors out of business. The second was price discrimination, where a railroad or corporation could charge different prices to favor bigger companies that did their bidding. Both predation and price discrimination helped companies with access to capital, which meant that these tactics placed control over commerce in the hands of the money trust of Wall Street. The antimonopoly laws were designed to block both harms, and thus, restrict Wall Street. But predatory practices and price discrimination can lower prices for consumers, at least on a temporary basis. <strong>â€” 470: 6701-6707</strong></p>
