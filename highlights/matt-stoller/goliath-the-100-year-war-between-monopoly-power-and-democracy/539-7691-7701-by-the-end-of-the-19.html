<h1>Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</h1>

<p>by the end of the 1980s, Wall Street had permanently changed corporate America. A new type of business model existed. The leveraged buyout industry, stung with bad publicity, rebranded as “private equity.” While some PE firms made productive investments, they were largely pools of floating capital that sought to use the corporation for the purpose of the financier.50 Strategically, the only businesses that were sustainable in the new legal environment were those that could withstand the pressures of financial raiders. Large-scale monopolistic corporations such as General Electric and Walmart could use the new tools to their advantage. So could high-tech concerns such as Microsoft that had taken advantage of the technology revolution to acquire choke holds over new vital arteries of commerce. Private equity firms and financial intermediaries who could use the new capital market structure to their advantage increasingly controlled American business. In previous eras in American history, the wreckage caused by such widespread looting would have led to substantial legal reforms. And there were some. But the key innovation, that the corporate structure exists as a mechanism for the extraction of cash for insiders from either the company itself or from a market that company monopolized, was here to stay. <strong>— 539: 7691-7701</strong></p>
