<h1>Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</h1>

<p>In time, Hofstadter’s work would help to all but erase the American historical tradition—tracing to the Revolution itself—that held that the great ideological conflict was between democracy and monopoly. “Americans may not have quarreled over profound ideological matters,” he wrote early in his career, “as these are formulated in the history of political thought, but they quarreled consistently enough over issues that had real pith and moment.” Pith and moment was a beautiful phrase, but what Hofstadter meant was that there were no conflicts in America in political economy, only social anxiety. It was too scary for Hofstadter to concede that democratic movements were anything but a rabid mob.57 <strong>— 287: 4091-4096</strong></p>
