<h1>Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</h1>

<p>Fighting back also means not falling into the trap of elitism. The weakness of the technocrat is “imposter syndrome,” a feeling that he or she doesn’t belong in a position of power, that his or her expertise is a pretense. This insecurity is what Aaron Director identified as his key to power. “Beautiful smugness” is how John Kenneth Galbraith and Richard Hofstadter persuaded a generation to give up their liberties. These men, Director in particular, understood that powerful liberal lawyers, well-respected and arrogant, were susceptible to mockery by their colleagues. Director made fun of lawyers who subscribed to common sense, creating a social context where an embrace of complex-seeming models by credentialed experts who were working for oligarchs overrode respect for justice, democracy, or basic human decency. In doing this, Director reoriented the elitist liberal brain, rewiring it for plutocracy without liberals even knowing. The only immunization against this is a democratic form of populism. I do not mean the toxic fake version of populism, demagogues and frauds blaming ethnic groups. I mean old-school populism, the belief that citizens, educated and responsible, know what is best for themselves. And united they come together in a system of democracy and use the law to protect and develop themselves. This populism does not disdain expertise, but embraces it. But expertise must serve the people; it must not be oriented to confuse them, to erect a new aristocracy. And that means you must never be afraid to say “I don’t know,” and you must do your best to remember that men in suits with impressive credentials can and often do lie, cheat, and steal. It’s true that humanity has a remarkable amount of accumulated knowledge, but as individuals, we’re all making it up as we go along. To do the work of being a citizen, each of us has to work hard, learn, build up a working body of knowledge. <strong>— 597: 8537-8550</strong></p>
