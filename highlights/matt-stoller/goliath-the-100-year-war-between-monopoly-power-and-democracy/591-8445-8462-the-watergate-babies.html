<h1>Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</h1>

<p>The Watergate Babies rejected the lessons of Patman’s generation for many reasons, conflating economic populism with an antiquated vision of the economy. But there was wisdom in Patman’s lessons. In the 1930s, he said that restricting chain stores would prevent “Hitler’s methods of government and business in Europe” from coming to the United States. For decades after World War II, preventing economic concentration was understood as a bulwark against tyranny. From the 1970s until the financial crisis, this rhetoric seemed ridiculous. No longer. Financial crises occur regularly now, and prices for essential goods and services reflect monopoly power rather than free citizens buying and selling to each other. People worldwide, sullen and unmoored from community structures, are turning to rage, apathy, protest, and angry tribalism. The reason for this dissatisfaction, the anxiety, is clear. The institutions that touch our lives are unreachable. We organize our social networks through Facebook, our information through Google, our health care from complex bureaucracies, our seeds and chemicals through seed monopolists. We sell our grain through Cargill and watch movies, buy groceries, books, and clothing through Amazon. Open markets are gone, replaced by a handful of corporate giants. We are increasingly addicted to opioids, sugary processed foods, and alcohol. We have no faith in what was once the most democratically responsive part of government, Congress. We cannot begin to address perhaps the most important existential challenge humanity has ever faced, climate change. Steeped in centralized power and mistrust, people all over the world face demagogues selling blame and hatred. But even more profound than the anxiety is the confusion. Our policymakers, until recently, saw giants like Google, Amazon, and Goldman Sachs as exemplars of the American spirit, instead of the dangerous re-creation of trading corporations seeking to control and enslave us—like the East India Company—against which we rebelled. They confused charity for justice, meekly asking our munificent plutocrats to raise our wages or donate their ill-gotten gains to charitable foundations plastered with their names. We have asked for new laws to offer welfare to the poor, instead of seeing poverty itself as a lack of freedom, as a denial of the basic rights of citizenship. This is not democracy. This is servitude. <strong>— 591: 8445-8462</strong></p>
