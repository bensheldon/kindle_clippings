<h1>Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</h1>

<p>“Liberalism” had been a word Roosevelt used to organize his political movement. In 1932, a reporter asked Roosevelt to describe his political philosophy. Roosevelt called himself “a liberal.” This did not mean, as classical liberalism had meant in much of the previous era, protecting the rights of industrial barons using the rhetoric of self-sufficiency. It meant moral leadership, the willingness to address a civilizational crisis by updating the machinery of governance. A liberal, Roosevelt said, broke from the past, but not too quickly to provoke violence.23 After the war, Berle would again redefine the term “liberal,” slowly changing it to mean a form of soft corporatism. He did this by using the Red Scare to centralize power over postwar policy development into a small network of planners and Ivy League intellectuals, what conservatives derisively called “eggheads.” Over the next twenty-five years, liberalism would come to mean a gentle form of elitism. And since Roosevelt had called himself a liberal, this became what Democratics increasingly believed the New Deal had been. <strong>— 276: 3942-3951</strong></p>
