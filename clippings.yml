    and noncommercial culture, and by mapping the law’s regulation of each. By “commercial
    culture” I mean that part of our culture that is produced and sold or produced
    to be sold. By “noncommercial culture” I mean all the rest. When old men sat around
    parks or on street corners telling stories that kids and others consumed, that
    was noncommercial culture. When Noah Webster published his “Reader,” or Joel Barlow
    his poetry, that was commercial culture.

  content: 'Fred Gealy23, in an essay called “Encounter and Dialogue”, suggests we
    begin our dialogue with sacred literature by first asking what the writer actually
    says, allowing authors to speak for themselves rather than beginning with our
    beliefs, assumptions or someone else’s interpretation. We let them “have their
    say.” We look for the actual words and phrases themselves. He then says we need
    to ask what happened in the story, because much of the world’s sacred literature
    takes a narrative form. We break out the steps taken and find the elements of
    a given story or passage. What were the events? He calls them “happenednesses.”
    He asks us to look at the historical, economic, political, social and cultural
    context. What was really going on? We find the objective occurrences and set them
    in context. We isolate and identify the human dynamics in the story. His next
    step suggests that we ask our own questions. In light of what happened in the
    stories, we surface the questions that are raised in our own very real lives today,
    the “existential questions” that strike deep into the core of our beings and raise
    foundational questions about our very nature. These are the questions that do
    not go away. They trigger an inquiry or a search for the answers that will enable
    us to consciously shape our lives. We draw relationships between the happenednesses
    and our own situation. It is easy to see this as two distinct steps: 1) a reflective
    self-examination, followed by 2) relating our own life experience to the story.
    It is only then, Gealy says, that it is appropriate to ask about the message we
    take from the story or text. How does it impact me in my real situation? How do
    I come up with answers to the questions I face? How do I determine my sense of
    identity and purpose? It is these pressing questions that focus the message and
    make it personal. It is the answers that provide a framework for authentic meaning
    and significance for each person. Gealy’s insights into applied phenomenology
    gave rise to ICA’s methods, first as study and teaching methodologies and later
    as the ToP facilitation methodologies. As they evolved, they were applied to all
    kinds of challenges in organisations and communities. The technology in the Technology
    of Participation (ToP) is the phenomenological method.   Phenomenology as method
      Combining the methods used in demythologizing with insights from Suzanne Langer24,
    Gealy and others led to the creation of a unique approach to phenomenological
    inquiry.'

  content: The methodology itself, as medium, is the message. “Your ideas are relevant
    and valuable.” “The group needs the best wisdom available to make the wisest decisions.”
    “You can shape your situation and your world.” These ideas are integrated into
    ToP facilitation through a complex of values, practices and application of methodology.
    ToP facilitators often say these things directly because they are using a methodology
    that supports them. ToP methodology provides a process through which an individual
    or a group can pursue, in principle, any inquiry. It enables groups to examine
    their own images or pictures of a situation in relationship to a topic. Each participant
    contributes, from their own perspective, thoughts relevant to the question at
    hand. As the group reflects on the compilation of ideas, their picture of the
    situation grows, develops and changes. They make meaning together.

  content: The process of development and the formation of developmental strategy
    is a complex, interrelated whole that contains specific and very real polarities.
    At the most general level, there is a tension between the group’s vision for the
    future and the complex of factors that negate the vision or hinder its fulfillment.
    Seeing the specific barriers in relation to a vision enables a group to see their
    whole strategic situation and identify key underlying contradictions that must
    be addressed if they are to realize their vision. Naming those contradictions
    provides a platform for strategic thinking. This analysis provides insight into
    steps and strategic directions that can be taken to address the group’s situation
    in an authentic, future-oriented way. When they have identified their strategies,
    the group can create specific, practical action plans to implement their chosen
    strategies. This process has become known as the ToP Strategic Planning Method.
    ToP action planning rounds out the basic suite of ToP applications. The core of
    this method includes identifying a desired future state, analyzing the hindering
    and supporting factors in the present situation, naming concrete commitments given
    the present reality, generating actions toward those commitments, and timelining
    the actions with assignments and estimated costs. The ToP journey wall applies
    the charting approach to time and historical events to enable a group to look
    at, discuss, create a story of their journey, and learn from their past experience.

  content: 'In Western society, we struggle with articulating the reflective level.
    Reducing the reflective level questions to “How did this make you feel?” generates
    very little information, and many people avoid answering. More useful and appropriate
    information is elicited with several more specific questions, such as “What part
    of this made you uncomfortable, and which part were you pleased with?” Questions
    that elicit memories or past experiences can also be very helpful in allowing
    people to pay attention to their inner experience. The most successful interpretive
    questions are specifically crafted to explore insights in relation to the aim
    of the conversation. For example, if the aim is to understand a policy, one interpretive
    question may be “What implications might this policy have for our daily work?”
    Decisional level questions also work best when they are specific to the aim of
    the conversation. Sometimes a group decision is necessary, so articulating it
    is useful: “What have we decided to do?” Sometimes individual decisions are important:
    “What will you do next to apply what you’ve learned today?” Sometimes both are
    needed. Leaving the room without any decisional question will leave the group
    hanging and unsatisfied. If a decision is not possible, deciding not to decide
    and when to come back to the topic can be sufficient. After'

  content: Gestalt in this context is about seeing “‘patterns of meaning” in a whole
    set of ideas given in relation to a specific question. The individual responses
    to the focus question will, if the focus question is well-designed, be comprehensive
    in addressing the question. The task is to discern the major themes of thought
    or distinct answers to the given question. There may be many connections and associations
    among the ideas. There may be causes and effects. There may be words that are
    similar or seem to have similar meanings. The key factor in distilling useful
    meaning from this process is the question used as the guide, the focus question.
    It focuses the generation of ideas and guides discernment of the thought patterns
    of the responses. The question becomes the fundamental reference point for a whole
    inquiry and all of its parts. The patterns are named as the group’s response to
    the focus question. It must be understood that this is a process of synthesis
    rather than analysis. One of the easy temptations in performing this process is
    the tendency to sort elements into categories that are already integrated into
    our understanding even if they are not consciously identified. It is, without
    question, much easier for both the participant and the facilitator to sort into
    known categories, but sorting only organizes previous ideas, and does not create
    new ideas. Analytical methodologies play a necessary role in processing ideas
    when an overall framework is already firmly in place.

  content: Western thought emphasizes and teaches analysis, sorting and categorizing
    from an early age. On Sesame Street they ask, “Which of these is not like the
    others?” It is easy to create categories and sort ideas into them, but no new
    knowledge or understanding is created, and “miscellaneous” categories are created,
    effectively marginalizing ideas that are different or outliers. In contrast, the
    consensus workshop method is best used to synthesize new ideas from a diversity
    of individual ideas. This approach completely sidesteps the question of agreeing
    or disagreeing with someone else’s idea; it asks how each unique idea can contribute
    to something the group has not seen before.

  content: Psychologists sometimes refer to the kind of dilemmas described in this
    section as “scriptlessness.” Psychological studies, for instance, find that men
    or women who had experienced unrequited love during adolescence were in most cases
    eventually able to come to terms with the experience and showed few permanent
    emotional scars. But for those who had been the objects of unrequited love, it
    was quite another matter. Many still struggled with guilt and confusion. One major
    reason, researchers concluded, was precisely the lack of cultural models. Anyone
    who falls in love with someone who does not return their affections has thousands
    of years’ worth of romantic literature to tell them exactly how they are supposed
    to feel; however, while this literature provides detailed insight on the experience
    of being Cyrano, it generally tells you very little about how you are supposed
    to feel—let alone what you’re supposed to do—if you’re Roxane.7 Many, probably
    most, bullshit jobs involve a similar agonizing scriptlessness. Not only are the
    codes of behavior ambiguous, no one is even sure what they are supposed to say
    or how they are supposed to feel about their situation.

    the ceiling as if for the word, “… you say, ‘altruism.’ This is a question in
    your animal studies. Does true altruism exist, and is it a good adaptation? Does
    compassion work, in other words? You have done studies that suggest altruism is
    the best adaptive strategy, if seen from the group context. This then becomes
    a kind of … admonishment. To practice compassion in order to successfully evolve—this,
    coming from your science, which claims to be descriptive only! Only describing
    what has worked to make us what we are. But in Buddhism we have always said, if
    you want to help others, practice compassion; if you want to help yourself, practice
    compassion. Now science adds, if you want to help your species, practice compassion.”
    This got a laugh, and Frank also chuckled. He started to think about it in terms
    of prisoners’ dilemma strategies; it was an invocation for all to make the always
    generous move, for maximum group return, indeed maximum individual return.… Thus
    he missed what Drepung said next, absorbed in something more like a feeling than
    a thought: If only I could believe in something, no doubt it would be a relief.
    All his rationality, all his acid skepticism; suddenly it was hard not to feel
    that it was really just some kind of disorder. And at that very moment Rudra Cakrin
    looked right at him, him alone in all the audience, and Drepung said, “An excess
    of reason is itself a form of madness.” Frank sat back in his seat. What had the
    question been? Rerunning his short-term memory, he could not find it. Now he was
    lost to the conversation again. His flesh was tingling, as if he were a bell that
    had been struck. “The experience of enlightenment can be sudden.” He didn’t hear
    that, not consciously. “The scattered parts of consciousness occasionally assemble
    at once into a whole pattern.” He didn’t hear that either, as he was lost in thought.
    All his certainties were trembling. He thought, an excess of reason itself a form
    of madness—it’s the story of my life. And the old man knew."

  content: 'recognized as value-creating labor in itself. “Caring labor” is generally
    seen as work directed at other people, and it always involves a certain labor
    of interpretation, empathy, and understanding. To some degree, one might argue
    that this is not really work at all, it’s just life, or life lived properly—humans
    are naturally empathetic creatures, and to communicate with one another at all,
    we must constantly cast ourselves imaginatively into each other’s shoes and try
    to understand what others are thinking and feeling, which usually means caring
    about them at least a little—but it very much becomes work when all the empathy
    and imaginative identification is on one side. The key to caring labor as a commodity
    is not that some people care but that others don’t; that those paying for “services”
    (note how the old feudal term is still retained) feel no need to engage in interpretive
    labor themselves. This is even true of a bricklayer, if that bricklayer is working
    for someone else. Underlings have to constantly monitor what the boss is thinking;
    the boss doesn’t have to care. That, in turn, is one reason, I believe, why psychological
    studies regularly find that people of working-class background are more accurate
    at reading other people’s feelings, and more empathetic and caring, than those
    of middle-class, let alone wealthy, backgrounds.47 To some degree, the skill at
    reading others’ emotions is just an effect of what working-class work actually
    consists of: rich people don’t have to learn how to do interpretive labor nearly
    as well because they can hire other people to do it for them. Those hirelings,
    on the other hand, who have to develop a habit of understanding other’s points
    of view, will also tend to care about them.48 By this token, as many feminist
    economists have pointed out, all labor can be seen as caring labor, since—to turn
    to an example from the beginning of the chapter—even if one builds a bridge, it’s
    ultimately because one cares about people who might wish to cross the river. As
    the examples I cited at the time make clear, people do really think in these terms
    when they reflect on the “social value” of their jobs.49 To think of labor as
    valuable primarily because it is “productive,” and productive labor as typified
    by the factory worker, effecting that magic transformation by which cars or teabags
    or pharmaceutical products are “produced” out of factories through the same painful
    but ultimately mysterious “labor” by which women are seen to produce babies, allows
    one to make all this disappear. It also makes it maximally easy for the factory
    owner to insist that no, actually, workers are really no different from the machines
    they operate. Clearly, the growth of what came to be called “scientific management”
    made this easier; but it would never have been possible had the paradigmatic example
    of “worker” in the popular imagination been a cook, a gardener, or a masseuse.'

    culture, religion)—and more and more as an end in itself. Yet at the same time
    it was an end in itself that most people found harmful, degrading, and oppressive.
    How to reconcile these two observations? One way might be to return to the arguments
    I made in chapter 3 and to acknowledge that human beings essentially are a set
    of purposes, so that without any sense of purpose, we would barely be said to
    exist at all.'

  content: Another reason I hesitate to make policy suggestions is that I am suspicious
    of the very idea of policy. Policy implies the existence of an elite group—government
    officials, typically—that gets to decide on something (“a policy”) that they then
    arrange to be imposed on everybody else. There’s a little mental trick we often
    play on ourselves when discussing such matters. We say, for instance, “What are
    we going to do about the problem of X?” as if “we” were society as a whole, somehow
    acting on ourselves, but, in fact, unless we happen to be part of that roughly
    3 percent to 5 percent of the population whose views actually do affect policy
    makers, this is all a game of make-believe; we are identifying with our rulers
    when, in fact, we’re the ones being ruled. This is what happens when we watch
    a politician on television say “What shall we do about the less fortunate?” even
    though at least half of us would almost certainly fit that category ourselves.
    Myself, I find such games particularly pernicious because I’d prefer not to have
    policy elites around at all. I’m personally an anarchist, which means that, not
    only do I look forward to a day sometime in the future when governments, corporations,
    and the rest will be looked at as historical curiosities in the same way as we
    now look at the Spanish Inquisition or nomadic invasions, but I prefer solutions
    to immediate problems that do not give more power to governments or corporations,
    but rather, give people the means to manage their own affairs.

    people fall into the same dynamic, there’s never such an easy way out. “You can’t
    say ‘orange’ to your boss.” It’s always occurred to me this insight is important
    and could even become the basis for a theory of social liberation. I like to think
    that Michel Foucault, the French social philosopher, was moving in this direction
    before his tragic death in 1984. Foucault, according to people who knew him, underwent
    a remarkable personal transformation on discovering BDSM, turning from a notoriously
    cagey and standoffish personality to one suddenly warm, open, and friendly23—but
    his theoretical ideas also entered into a period of transformation that he was
    never able to fully bring to fruit. Foucault, of course, is famous mainly as a
    theorist of power, which he saw as flowing through all human relationships, even
    as the basic substance of human sociality, since he once defined it as simply
    a matter of “acting on another’s actions.”24 This always created a peculiar paradox
    because while he wrote in such a way as to suggest he was an antiauthoritarian
    opposed to power, he defined power in such a way that social life would impossible
    without it. At the very end of his career, he seems to have aimed to resolve the
    dilemma by introducing a distinction between what he called power and domination.
    The first, he said, was just a matter of “strategic games.” Everyone is playing
    power games all the time, we can hardly help it, but neither is there anything
    objectionable about our doing so. So in this, his very last interview:'

  content: 'Organisation of this book There are three parts to this story. The first,
    and necessarily the longest, antithesis: a deconstruction of the state of OOP
    as it exists today. To get to the kernel of a good idea, you have to crack a few
    nuts. Part one is the agitation that necessarily precedes revolution. The second
    part, thesis: a reconstruction of OOP using only the parts that were left over
    after the antithesis. Part two is the manifesto: once we’ve seen that the last
    few decades of status quo haven’t been working for us, we can evaluate something
    that will. The third, synthesis: a discussion of the ideas from OOP that aren’t
    being provided by today’s object systems, and the ideas and problems that OOP
    doesn’t yet address at all. These are the next steps to take to pursue the ideas
    behind object thinking. Part three is the call to action. This is not a pure takedown,
    a suggestion that we have been monotonically doing it wrong for three decades:
    the antithesis part of this book questions, rejects and destroys a lot of built
    aspects of OOP, but by no means all of them. And by no means purely the later
    ones, either: the message is not that Smalltalk was created in some computational
    garden of Eden and that Sun tasted of the forbidden fruit which doomed us all
    to Java. Belief in a primaeval wisdom (urwissenheit) leads to an uncritical “tradition
    for tradition’s sake” in the same way that belief in primaeval stupidity (urdummheit)
    leads to an uncritical “novelty for novelty’s sake”. Rather this is an attempt
    to find a consistent philosophy, a way of thinking about software, and to find
    the threads in the narrative and dialectic history of the making of software that
    are supportive and unsupportive of that way of thinking. Because OOP is supposed
    to be a paradigm, a pattern of thought, and if we want to adopt that paradigm
    then we have to see how different tools or techniques support, damage, or modify
    our thoughts.'

  content: 'Behaviour-Driven Development marries the technical process of Test-Driven
    Development with the design concept of the ubiquitous language, by encouraging
    developers to collaborate with the rest of their team on defining statements of
    desired behaviour in the ubiquitous language and using those to drive the design
    and implementation of the objects in the solution domain. In that way, the statement
    of what the Goal Donor needs is also the statement of sufficiency and correctness
    - i.e. the description of the problem that needs solving is also the description
    of a working solution. This ends up looking tautological enough not to be surprising.
    Constructing Independent Objects The theme running through the above is that sufficiency
    is sufficient. When an object has been identified as part of the solution to a
    problem, and contributes to that solution to the extent needed (even if for now
    that extent is “demonstrate that a solution is viable”), then it is ready to use.
    There is no need to situate the object in a taxonomy of inherited classes - but
    if that helps to solve the problem, then by all means do it. There is no need
    to show that various objects demonstrate a strict subtype relationship and can
    be used interchangeably, unless solving your problem requires that they be used
    interchangeably. There is no need for an object to make its data available to
    the rest of the program, unless the problem can be better solved (or cheaper solved,
    or some other desirable property) by doing so. I made quite a big deal above of
    the open-closed principle, and its suggestion that the objects we build be “open
    to modification”. Doesn’t that mean anticipating the ways in which a system will
    change and making it possible for the objects to flex in those ways? To some extent,
    yes, and indeed that consideration can be valuable. If your problem is working
    out how much to bill snooker players for their time on the tables in your local
    snooker hall, then it is indeed possible that your solution will be used in the
    same hall on the pool tables, or in a different snooker hall. But which of those
    will happen first, will either happen soon? Those are questions to work with the
    Goal Donor and the Gold Owner (the person paying for the solution) on answering.
    Is it worth paying to solve this related problem now, or not? Regardless of the
    answer, the fact is that the objects are still ready to go to work as soon as
    they address the problem you have now. And there are other ways to address related
    problems anyway, which don’t require “future-proofing” the object designs to anticipate
    the uses to which they may be put. Perhaps your SnookerTable isn’t open to the
    extension of representing a pool table too, but the rest of the objects in your
    solution can send messages to a PoolPlayer in its stead. As the variant on the
    Open-Closed Principle above showed, these other objects could be ignorant of the
    game played on the table. Some amount of planning is always helpful, whether or
    not the plan turns out to be. The goal at every turn should be to understand how
    we get to what we now want from what we have now, not to already have that which
    we will probably want sometime. Maybe the easiest thing to do is to start afresh:
    so do that.'

    “you have entrusted me with the job of president during a difficult time. The
    crisis we face now, of abrupt climate change and crippling damage to the biosphere,
    is a very dangerous one, to be sure. But we are not at war with anyone, and in
    fact we face a challenge that all humanity has to meet together. On this podium,
    Franklin Roosevelt said, ‘This generation has a rendezvous with destiny.’ Now
    it’s true again. We are the generation that has to deal with the profound destruction
    that will be caused by the global warming that has already been set in motion.
    The potential disruption of the natural order is so great that scientists warn
    of a mass extinction event. Losses on that scale would endanger all humanity,
    and so we cannot fail to address the threat. The lives of our children, and all
    their descendants, depend on us doing so. “So, like FDR and his generation, we
    have to face the great challenge of our time. We have to use our government to
    organize a total social response to the problem. That took courage then, and we
    will need courage now. In the years since we used our government to help get us
    out of the Great Depression, it has sometimes been fashionable to belittle the
    American government as some kind of foreign burden laid on us. That attitude is
    nothing more than an attack on American history, deliberately designed to shift
    power away from the American people. I want us to remember how Abraham Lincoln
    said it: ‘that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall
    not perish from this Earth.’ This is the crucial concept of American democracy—that
    government expresses what the majority of us would like to do as a society. It’s
    us. We do it to us and for us. I believe this reminder is so important that I
    intend to add the defining phrase ‘of the people, by the people, and for the people’
    every time I use the word ‘government,’ and I intend to do all I can to make that
    phrase be a true description. It will make me even more long-winded than I was
    before, but I am willing to pay that price, and you are going to have to pay it
    with me. “So, this winter, with your approval and support, I intend to instruct
    my team in the executive branch of government of the people, by the people, and
    for the people, to initiate a series of federal actions and changes designed to
    meet the problem of global climate change head-on. We will deal with it as a society
    working together, and working with the rest of the world. It’s a global project,
    and so I will go to the United Nations and tell them that the United States is
    ready to join the international effort. We will also help the under-developed
    world to develop using clean technology, so that all the good aspects of development
    will not be drowned in its bad side effects—often literally drowned. In our own
    country, meanwhile, we will do all it takes to shift to clean technologies as
    quickly as possible.” Phil paused to survey the crowd. “My, it’s cold out here
    today! You can feel right now, right down to the bone, that what I am saying is
    true. We’re out in the cold, and we need to change the way we do things. And it’s
    not just a technological problem, having to do with our machinery alone. The devastation
    of the biosphere is also a result of there being too many human beings for the
    planet to support over the long haul. If the human population continues to increase
    as it has risen in the past, all progress we might make will be overwhelmed. “But
    what is very striking to observe is that everywhere on this Earth where good standards
    of justice prevail, the rate of reproduction is about at the replacement rate.
    While wherever justice, and the full array of rights as described in the UN Declaration
    of Human Rights, is somehow denied to some portion of the population, especially
    to women and children, the rate of reproduction either balloons to unsustainably
    rapid growth rates, or crashes outright. Now you can argue all you want about
    why this correlation exists, but the correlation itself is striking and undeniable.
    So this is one of those situations in which what we do for good in one area, helps
    us again in another. It is a positive feedback loop with the most profound implications.
    Consider: for the sake of climate stabilization, there must be population stabilization;
    and for there to be population stabilization, justice must prevail. Every person
    on the planet must live with the full array of human rights that all nations have
    already ascribed to when signing the UN Charter. When we achieve that, at that
    point, and at that point only, we will begin to reproduce at a sustainable rate.
    “To help that to happen, I intend to make sure that the United States joins the
    global justice project fully, unequivocally, and without any double standards.
    This means accepting the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, and
    the jurisdiction of the World Court in the Hague. It means abiding by all the
    clauses of the UN Charter and the Geneva Conventions, which after all we have
    already signed. It means supporting UN peacekeeping forces, and supporting the
    general concept of the UN as the body through which international conflicts get
    resolved. It means supporting the World Health Organization in all its reproductive
    rights and population reduction efforts. It means supporting women’s education
    and women’s rights everywhere, even in cultures where men’s tyrannies are claimed
    to be some sort of tradition. All these commitments on our part will be crucial
    if we are serious about building a sustainable world. There are three legs to
    this effort, folks: technology, environment, and social justice. None of the three
    can be neglected. “So, some of what we do may look a little unconventional at
    first. And it may look more than a little threatening to those few who have been
    trying, in effect, to buy our government of the people, by the people, and for
    the people, and use it to line their own pockets while the world goes smash. But
    you know what? Those people need to change too. They’re out in the cold the same
    as the rest of us. So we will proceed, and hope those opposed come to see the
    good in it. “Ultimately we will be exploring all peaceful means to initiate positive
    changes in our systems, in order to hand on to the generations to come a world
    that is as beautiful and bountiful as the one we were born into. We are only the
    temporary stewards of a mighty trust, which includes the lives of all the future
    generations to come. We are responsible to our children and theirs. What we do
    now will reveal much about our character and our values as a people. We have to
    rise to the occasion, and I think we can and will. I am going to throw myself
    into the effort wholeheartedly and with a feeling of high excitement, as if beginning
    a long journey over stormy seas.”"

    ‘notional demand,’ which is what they would buy if they could, and then ‘completely
    adjusted demand,’ which is what they really intend to buy knowing all the constraints,
    using what he calls ‘expectation theory.’ Between those you have ‘partially adjusted
    demand,’ where the consumer is in ignorance of what’s possible, or in denial about
    the situation, and still not completely adjusted. So the move from notional demand
    to completely adjusted demand is marked by failure, frustration, dire rumors,

    the buyer has abandoned certain intentions, and might even forget them if asked.

    worried that they weren’t really doing more than just building their own version
    of the klept. Which Ainsley had said was not just a good thing but an essential
    thing, for all of them to keep in mind. Because people who couldn’t imagine themselves
    capable of evil were at a major disadvantage in dealing with people who didn’t
    need to imagine, because they already were. She’d said it was always a mistake,
    to believe those people were different, special, infected with something that
    was inhuman, subhuman, fundamentally other. Which had reminded her of what her
    mother had said about Corbell Picket. That evil wasn’t glamorous, but just the
    result of ordinary half-assed badness, high school badness, given enough room,
    however that might happen, to become its bigger self. Bigger, with more horrible
    results, but never more than the cumulative weight of ordinary human baseness.
    And this was true, Ainsley had said, of the very worst monsters, among whom she
    herself had so long moved. Her job in London, she’d said, might seem to Flynne
    to be a patient caretaker amid large and specially venomous animals, but that
    wasn’t the case. “All too human, dear,” Ainsley had said, her blue old eyes looking
    at the Thames, “and the moment we forget it, we’re lost.”

  content: 'Much of who I am and what I do is wrapped up in my father’s offering by
    the lakeshore. Each day still begins with a version of “Here’s to the gods of
    Tahawus,” a thanksgiving for the day. My work as an ecologist, a writer, a mother,
    as a traveler between scientific and traditional ways of knowing, grows from the
    power of those words. It reminds me of who we are; it reminds me of our gifts
    and our responsibility to those gifts. Ceremony is a vehicle for belonging—to
    a family, to a people, and to the land. At last, I thought that I understood the
    offering to the gods of Tahawus. It was, for me, the one thing that was not forgotten,
    that which could not be taken by history: the knowing that we belonged to the
    land, that we were the people who knew how to say thank you. It welled up from
    a deep blood memory that the land, the lakes, and the spirit had held for us.
    But years later, with my own answer already in place, I asked my father, “Where
    did the ceremony come from—did you learn it from your father, and he from his?
    Did it stretch all the way back to the time of the canoes?” He thought for a long
    time. “No, I don’t think so. It’s just what we did. It seemed right.” That was
    all. Some weeks went by, though, and when we spoke again he said, “I’ve been thinking
    about the coffee and how we started giving it to the ground. You know, it was
    boiled coffee. There’s no filter and if it boils too hard the grounds foam up
    and get stuck in the spout. So the first cup you pour would get that plug of grounds
    and be spoiled. I think we first did it to clear the spout.” It was as if he’d
    told me that the water didn’t change to wine—the whole web of gratitude, the whole
    story of remembrance, was nothing more than the dumping of the grounds? “But,
    you know,” he said, “there weren’t always grounds to clear. It started out that
    way, but it became something else. A thought. It was a kind of respect, a kind
    of thanks. On a beautiful summer morning, I suppose you could call it joy.” That,
    I think, is the power of ceremony: it marries the mundane to the sacred. The water
    turns to wine, the coffee to a prayer. The material and the spiritual mingle like
    grounds mingled with humus, transformed like steam rising from a mug into the
    morning mist. What else can you offer the earth, which has everything? What else
    can you give but something of yourself? A homemade ceremony, a ceremony that makes
    a home.'

    and generous enough to be able to sustain its partners. It engages land not as
    a machine but as a community of respected nonhuman persons to whom we humans have
    a responsibility. Restoration requires renewing the capacity not only for “ecosystem
    services” but for “cultural services” as well. Renewal of relationships includes
    water that you can swim in and not be afraid to touch. Restoring relationship
    means that when the eagles return, it will be safe for them to eat the fish. People
    want that for themselves, too. Biocultural restoration raises the bar for environmental
    quality of the reference ecosystem, so that as we care for the land, it can once
    again care for us. Restoring land without restoring relationship is an empty exercise.
    It is relationship that will endure and relationship that will sustain the restored
    land. Therefore, reconnecting people and the landscape is as essential as reestablishing
    proper hydrology or cleaning up contaminants. It is medicine for the earth.

    would be likely to emerge. Technology is an important site of these struggles:
    not only is militant opposition to technology a historical fact, but it can suggest

    definition in her tract: “sabotage” referred to any effort “to limit his production
    in proportion to his remuneration,” or in other words, “the deliberate withdrawal
    of efficiency by a competent worker.” Rather than argue, as Smith did, for the
    salutary effects of sabotage for class consciousness, Flynn argued that workers
    already engaged in sabotage all the time, but without having a consistent name
    for what they were doing. Flynn quotes a worker at the Paterson silk mill in New
    Jersey, where organizers debated the efficacy of sabotage during the 1913 strike:
    I never heard of this thing called sabotage before Mr. Boyd spoke about it on
    the platform. I know once in a while when I want a half-day off and they won’t
    give it to me I slip the belt off the machine so it won’t run and I get my half
    day. I don’t know whether you call that sabotage, but that’s what I do.29 As Flynn
    noted, “one member of the executive committee after another admitted they had
    used this thing but they ‘didn’t know that was what you called it!’” Flynn’s analysis
    of sabotage was, in this sense, eminently Marxist: rather than dictate strategy
    in a top-down manner, she conceptualized the actually existing tactics of workers
    as a fundamental component of class struggle. “We are to see what the workers
    are doing,” she wrote, “and then try to understand why they do it; not tell them
    it’s right or it’s wrong, but analyze the condition.”'

    a revolutionary class has to “explode the continuum of history.” Indeed, this
    history is not a tale of progress, or even a succession of events, but “one single
    catastrophe, which unceasingly piles rubble on top of rubble and hurls it before
    his feet.”73 Elsewhere, Benjamin is even more explicit on this point: “Marx says
    that revolutions are the locomotive of world history. But perhaps it is quite
    otherwise. Perhaps revolutions are an attempt by the passengers on this train—namely,
    the human race—to activate the emergency brake.”74 Here an openly decelerationist
    Benjamin emerges. Technology does not lead toward a revolutionary break, nor does
    a revolution necessarily spur on new technological developments. Rather, Benjamin
    reconceives revolution as a cessation of catastrophe. It halts “progress” in its
    tracks.'

    the past two centuries often had a Luddish bent: they understood new machines
    as weapons wielded against them in their struggles for a better life, and treated
    them as such. Intellectuals on both sides of the class struggle often characterized
    this perspective as shortsightedness, or downright irrationality. In spite of
    their political commitments to the working class, Marxist theoreticians often
    saw the capitalist development of technology as the means for creating both abundance
    and leisure, which would be realized once the masses finally took the reins of
    government and industry. These arguments continue to be made today: to take two
    examples, Leigh Phillips and Michal Rozworski’s People’s Republic of Walmart sees
    the discount retailer as the anticipation of socialist logistics, and Aaron Bastani’s
    Fully Automated Luxury Communism devotes itself to speculative technologies like
    driverless cars and asteroid mining, with a “communist” coda at the end.1 Both
    works self-consciously pitch themselves as restoring faith in a progressive, but
    politically neutral, technological telos, against a left politics that is small
    scale and “primitivist.” It is my contention, supported by the history of thought
    and action in the preceding pages, that the radical left can and should put forth
    a decelerationist politics: a politics of slowing down change, undermining technological
    progress, and limiting capital’s rapacity, while developing organization and cultivating
    militancy. Letting Walmart or Amazon swallow the globe not only entrenches exploitative
    models of production and distribution; it channels resources to reactionary billionaires
    who use their wealth to further undermine the relative position of workers by
    funding conservative causes like tax cuts, school privatization, and opposition
    to gay marriage.2 Letting technology take its course will lead not to egalitarian
    outcomes, but authoritarian ones, as the ultra-wealthy expend their resources
    on shielding themselves from any accountability to the rest of us: postapocalyptic
    bunkers, militarized yachts, private islands, and even escapes to outer space.3
    Decelerationist politics is not the same as the “slow lifestyle” politics popular
    among segments of the better-off: “ways of being,” as Carl Honoré puts it in the
    movement’s manifesto, In Praise of Slowness, that emphasize “calm, careful, receptive,
    still, intuitive, unhurried, patient, reflective, quality-over-quantity.”4 As
    pleasing as slow aesthetics might be, I am not content to ground my argument in
    claims that a particular pace of life is “a more natural, human” one,5 nor do
    I seek, as Honoré does, to give the capitalist system “a human face.”6 The argument
    for deceleration is not based on satisfying nature, human or otherwise, but in
    recognizing the challenges facing strategies for organizing the working class.
    The constant churn of recomposition and reorganization, what media scholar Nick
    Dyer-Witheford calls “the digital vortex” of contemporary capitalism, scarcely
    gives workers time to get back on their feet, let alone fight.7 Decelerationism
    is not a withdrawal to a slower pace of life, but the manifestation of an antagonism
    toward the progress of elites at the expense of the rest of us. It is Walter Benjamin’s
    emergency brake. It is a wrench in the gears. This is to say, my argument is not
    based on lifestyle, or even ethics; it is based on politics.'

    forms of work.8 Majorities oppose algorithmic automation of judgement in parole
    cases, job applications, and financial assessment, even when they acknowledge

  content: 'Bureaucratic work shapes people’s consciousness in decisive ways. Among
    other things, it regularizes people’s experiences of time and indeed routinizes
    their lives by engaging them on a daily basis in rational, socially approved,
    purposive action; it brings them into daily proximity with and subordination to
    authority, creating in the process upward-looking stances that have decisive social
    and psychological consequences; it places a premium on a functionally rational,
    pragmatic habit of mind that seeks specific goals; and it creates subtle measures
    of prestige and an elaborate status hierarchy that, in addition to fostering an
    intense competition for status, also makes the rules, procedures, social contexts,
    and protocol of an organization paramount psychological and behavioral guides.
    In fact, bureaucratic contexts typically bring together men and women who initially
    have little in common with each other except the impersonal frameworks of their
    organizations. Indeed, the enduring genius of the organizational form is that
    it allows individuals to retain bewilderingly diverse private motives and meanings
    for action as long as they adhere publicly to agreed-upon rules. Even the personal
    relationships that men and women in bureaucracies do subsequently fashion together
    are, for the most part, governed by explicit or implicit organizational rules,
    procedures, and protocol. As a result, bureaucratic work causes people to bracket,
    while at work, the moralities that they might hold outside the workplace or that
    they might adhere to privately and to follow instead the prevailing morality of
    their particular organizational situation. As a former vice-president of a large
    firm says: “What is right in the corporation is not what is right in a man’s home
    or in his church. What is right in the corporation is what the guy above you wants
    from you. That’s what morality is in the corporation.”* Of course, since public
    legitimacy and respectability depend, in part, on perceptions of one’s moral probity,
    one cannot admit to such a bracketing of one’s conventional moralities except,
    usually indirectly, within one’s managerial circles where such verities are widely
    recognized to be inapplicable except as public relations stances. In fact, though
    managers usually think of it as separate from decision making, public relations
    is an extremely important facet of managerial work, one that often requires the
    employment of practitioners with special expertise. Managers do not generally
    discuss ethics, morality, or moral rules-in-use in a direct way with each other,
    except perhaps in seminars organized by ethicists. Such seminars, however, are
    unusual and, when they do occur, are often strained, artificial, and often confusing
    even to managers since they frequently become occasions for the solemn public
    invocation, particularly by high-ranking managers, of conventional moralities
    and traditional shibboleths. What matters on a day-to-day basis are the moral
    rules-in-use fashioned within the personal and structural constraints of one’s
    organization. As it happens, these rules may vary sharply depending on various
    factors, such as proximity to the market, line or staff responsibilities, or one’s
    position in a hierarchy. Actual organizational moralities are thus contextual,
    situational, highly specific, and, most often, unarticulated.'

    civil service codes or to any ethic of public service. Their sole allegiances

    organized, to the groups and individuals in their world who can demand and command
    their loyalties, and to themselves and their own careers. Managers are thus the
    paradigm of the white-collar salaried employee.12 Their conservative public style
    and conventional demeanor hide their transforming role in our society. In my view,
    they are the principal carriers of the bureaucratic ethic in our era.

  content: The moral dilemmas posed by bureaucratic work are, in fact, pervasive,
    taken for granted, and, at the same time, regularly denied. Managers do, however,
    continually assess their decisions, their organizational milieux, and especially
    each other to ascertain which moral rules-in-use apply in given situations. Such
    assessments are always complex and most often intuitive. Essentially, managers
    try to gauge whether they feel “comfortable” with proposed resolutions to specific
    problems, a task that always involves an assessment of others’ organizational
    morality and a reckoning of the practical organizational and market exigencies
    at hand. The notion of comfort has many meanings. When applied to other persons,
    the idea of comfort is an intuitive measure of trustworthiness, reliability, and
    predictability in a polycentric world that managers often find troubling, ambiguous,
    and anxiety-laden. Such assessment of others’ organizational morality is a crucial
    aspect of a more general set of probations that are intrinsic to managerial work.
    Getting into the corporations presented me with much of what I eventually learned,
    although I realized this only in retrospect.* When I approached my field study
    of managers, I had, for example, no firm grasp of the subtle, ambiguous process
    by which managers assess their colleagues’ moral fitness, so to speak, for managerial
    life. Moreover, I did not know, or at least did not consciously understand, that
    managers would subject me, an outsider desiring to study their occupational morality,
    to the same searching assessment that they continuously make of each other.

  content: 'Most of these refusals were based, of course, on wholly practical rationales,
    although, as I later recognized, these often contained clues to themes that proved
    important in my subsequent work. The most common rationales, often given in concert,
    were: that there were no tangible organizational benefits to be gained from a
    study of managerial ethics because the project lacked a specific practical focus,
    or that the timing for the study was inappropriate because of “transitions” in
    a particular organization. Taken together and translated in light of later understanding,
    these mean that managers can afford to give approbation only to studies that officially
    are on a short leash and that can be publicly defended with the vocabularies of
    justification normally at hand in the corporation. I came to understand that such
    wariness is warranted because corporate hierarchies are almost always in political
    turmoil. The endless search for an organizational handle on the market—that is,
    rational structures to deal with the irrational—coupled with managers’ ambitions
    and what I shall call their mobility panic, fuel a never-ending succession of
    personnel changes, marked by intense personal rivalries, in virtually all big
    corporations. Nosy outsiders can only complicate already troublesome, or potentially
    troublesome, situations. Some managers seemed sympathetic to the study, although
    they encouraged me to recast it as a technical issue, such as the “problem of
    executive succession in multinationals.” They objected in particular to those
    aspects of my brief written proposal that discussed the ethical dilemmas of managerial
    work. They urged me to avoid any mention of ethics or values altogether and concentrate
    instead on the “decision-making process” where I could talk about “trade-offs”
    and focus on the “hard decisions between competing interests” that mark managerial
    work. Taking these cues, I rewrote and rewrote the proposal couching my problem
    in the bland, euphemistic language that I was rapidly learning is the lingua franca
    of the corporate world. But such recasting eroded whatever was distinctive about
    the project and some managers dismissed the study as a reinvention of the wheel.
    Moreover, following managers’ advice led me into ambiguous moral terrain with
    some of my academic colleagues. For instance, at one point, I approached a prominent
    academic ethicist, who had expressed a willingness to help me, with the sanitized
    proposal. He was “uncomfortable” with the revised version, arguing that I was
    not following the norms of “full disclosure.” He preferred instead the earlier
    proposal with the more explicit references to managerial ethics and, with the
    agreement that I would use this version, put me in touch with a high-ranking executive
    in a major corporation. Unfortunately, this executive felt “uncomfortable” with
    the idea of suggesting to his colleagues that an outsider, untested in the corporate
    world, examine their ethics. In effect, I could not get access to study managers’
    moral rules-in-use because I seemed unable to articulate the appropriate stance
    that would convince key managers that I already understood those rules and was
    thus a person with whom they could “feel comfortable” enough to trust. In the
    end, I gained access to several corporations through fortuitous circumstances
    and for reasons independent of any intrinsic merit that my proposed study of managerial
    ethics might have had. The'

    “aligning oneself with the dominant ideology of the moment” or, as another says,
    “bowing to whichever god currently holds sway.” Such ideologies or gods may be
    thought of as official definitions of reality. As I suggested earlier, bureaucracies
    allow their employees a diverse range of private motives for action in return
    for assent to common rules and official versions of reality, that is, explanations
    or accounts that serve or at least do not injure the organization itself. Organizations
    always try, of course, to mobilize employees’ belief in manufactured realities;
    such efforts always meet with some success particularly at the middle levels among
    individuals who still labor under the notion that success depends on sincerity.
    However, the belief of insiders in abstract goals is not a prerequisite for personal
    success; belief in and subordination to individuals who articulate organizational
    goals is. One must, however, to be successful in a bureaucratic work situation,
    be able to act, at a moment’s notice, as if official reality is the only reality.
    The contexts for understanding this meaning of team play are the complicated levels
    of conflict within corporations and the probationary state of mind endemic to
    managerial work.

    Someone who is talking about team play is out to squash dissent. It’s the most
    effective way to tell people who have different perspectives to shut up. You say
    that you want a team effort…. You can and you have to learn to keep your mouth
    shut. My boss is like that. Everyone likes him because he is like that. It’s hurt
    me because I have spoken out. It might be that someone has formed the opinion
    that I have interesting things to say, but more likely, it gives you a troublemaker
    label and that’s one that is truly hard to get rid of. The troublemaker is often
    a creative person but truly creative people don’t get ahead; to get ahead you
    have to be dependable and a team player. You have to be steady…. When I hear the
    word, I immediately think it’s an effort to crush dissent…. [Bosses] say they
    don’t want a yes man, but, in fact, most bosses don’t want to hear the truth.
    And this is particularly true if it disagrees with what they want to do. Younger
    managers learn quickly that, whatever the public protestations to the contrary,
    bosses generally want pliable and agreeable subordinates, especially during periods
    of crisis. Clique leaders want dependable, loyal allies. Those who regularly raise
    objections to what a boss or a clique leader really desires run the risk of being
    considered problems themselves and of being labeled “outspoken,” or “nonconstructive,”

    shame works. Shame is the gateway emotion to increased self-criticism, which leads
    to realisation, an apology, outrage and eventually meaningful action. We’re not
    holding our breaths that any appreciable numbers can be arsed to make the journey
    along that difficult chain of emotional honesty – many good people get past realisation,
    only to then get horribly stuck at apology – but we live in hope.’ ‘I understand,’
    I said, having felt that I too had yet to make the jump to apology. ‘It’s further
    evidence of satire being the engine of the Event,’ said Connie, ‘although if that’s
    true, we’re not sure for whose benefit.’ ‘Certainly not humans’,’ said Finkle,
    ‘since satire is meant to highlight faults in a humorous way to achieve betterment,
    and if anything, the presence of rabbits has actually made humans worse.’ ‘Maybe
    it’s the default position of humans when they feel threatened,’ I ventured, ‘although
    if I’m honest, I know a lot of people who claim to have “nothing against rabbits”
    but tacitly do nothing against the overt leporiphobia that surrounds them.’ ‘Or
    maybe it’s just satire for comedy’s sake and nothing else,’ added Connie, ‘or
    even more useless, satire that provokes a few guffaws but only low to middling
    outrage – but is coupled with more talk and no action. A sort of . . . empty cleverness.’
    ‘Maybe a small puff in the right moral direction is the best that could be hoped
    for,’ added Finkle thoughtfully. ‘Perhaps that’s what satire does – not change
    things wholesale but nudge the collective consciousness in a direction that favours
    justice and equality. Is there any more walnut cake?’"

  content: "“One of the paradoxes of game design is that the creativity of play is
    made possible by play’s opposite, which are rules,” he says. “Rules are in essence
    constraints, but games don’t feel that way. Basketball is an amazing example of
    this. When the rules are activated, what follows is fluid, unpredictable magic.
    If you read the rules, you would never guess that’s what emerges.” But Naismith’s
    original rules resulted in clumsy, low scoring affairs. Where does the magic come
    in? Zimmerman gives his classes an assignment where they try to improve tic-tac-toe.
    He asks them to write out the game’s existing rules on the whiteboard and then
    has them brainstorm gameplay adjustments that will ideally create a totally new
    experience. “My favorite variation was when the students altered just one rule:
    If you get three in a row, you lose. It was a small tweak, but it completely changed
    everything. I just thought it was so elegant.” A game becomes exponentially more
    fun once its players learn to get creative within its boundaries. It’s less about
    following the rules and more about filling in the gaps that exist between them.
    Zimmerman uses poker as an example. “There’s nothing in the rules about bluffing,”
    he says. “There’s not a rule that says you can lie if you don’t have a good hand.
    It’s intrinsic to the system. Bluffing is an emergent property that appears out
    of the negative space of the rules.” For a game designer, this is everything.
    It’s how a snow-day diversion evolves into a global phenomenon. “I’m getting chills
    just talking about it,” he says."

    happen all at once. They are connected not just in one direction, but in many
    directions simultaneously. To discuss them properly, it is necessary somehow to
    use a language that shares some of the same properties as the phenomena under
    discussion. Pictures work for this language better than words, because you can
    see all the parts of a picture at once. I will build up systems pictures gradually,
    starting with very simple ones. I think you’ll find that you can understand this
    graphical language easily.

    of that, when we do focus on flows, we tend to focus on inflows more easily than
    on outflows. Therefore, we sometimes miss seeing that we can fill a bathtub not
    only by increasing the inflow rate, but also by decreasing the outflow rate. Everyone
    understands that you can prolong the life of an oil-based economy by discovering
    new oil deposits. It seems to be harder to understand that the same result can
    be achieved by burning less oil. A breakthrough in energy efficiency is equivalent,
    in its effect on the stock of available oil, to the discovery of a new oil field—although
    different people profit from it.

    where teamwork is rarer than we might think, plenty of non-teams succeed. In fact,
    if your group is not meant to be a team, it’s far better to be clear about that
    than to waste time and energy pretending you’re something you’re not. Because
    that only creates false expectations, which leads to frustration and resentment.

    one of the executives had his laptop open and was intermittently typing away during

    does that?” He told me, “Yeah, I find it distracting.” So I asked the obvious
    question: “Why don’t you tell him to stop?” A pained look came across the CEO’s
    face as he answered, “I don’t know. I’m not his parent. Who am I to tell him how
    to act . . .” I wanted to interrupt him and scream, “You’re the friggin’ CEO!

  content: But perhaps most important of all, having too many people on a team makes
    team dynamics during meetings and other decision-making events almost impossible.
    That’s because a good team has to engage in two types of communication in order
    to optimize decision making, but only one of these is practical in a large group.
    According to Harvard’s Chris Argyris, those two types of communication are advocacy
    and inquiry. Basically, advocacy is the statement of ideas and opinions; inquiry
    is the asking of questions for clarity and understanding. When a group gets too
    large, people realize they are not going to get the floor back any time soon,
    so they resort almost exclusively to advocacy. It becomes like Congress (which
    is not designed to be a team) or the United Nations (ditto). One member says,
    “I think we should pursue proposal A,” provoking another member to say, “Well,
    I think we should pursue proposal B.” Someone else lobbies for C, yet another
    person wants A with a slight modification, and before you know it, everyone is
    trying to get their opinion heard. Inquiry, on the other hand, would entail one
    of the members saying, “Wait a minute. I’d like to hear you explain why you support
    proposal A, because I want to understand your rationale. After all, if it makes
    sense, I could go along with it.” Okay, that might be just a little too idealistic,
    but you get the point.

    that though the form of Christ certainly is and remains one and the same, yet
    it is willing to take form in the real man, that is to say, in quite different
    guises. Christ does not dispense with human reality for the sake of an idea which
    demands realization at the expense of the real. What Christ does is precisely
    to give effect to reality. He affirms reality. And indeed He is Himself the real
    man and consequently the foundation of all human reality.

  content: Most leaders get it wrong. They think that organizational productivity
    and performance are simply about policies, processes, structures, or systems.
    So when their software product doesn’t ship on time, they benchmark others’ development
    processes. Or when productivity flags, they tweak their performance management
    system. When teams aren’t cooperating, they restructure. Our research shows that
    these types of nonhuman changes fail more often than they succeed. That’s because
    the real problem never was in the process, system, or structure—it was in employee
    behavior. The key to real change lies not in implementing a new process, but in
    getting people to hold one another accountable to the process. And that requires
    Crucial Conversations skills. In the worst companies, poor performers are first
    ignored and then transferred. In good companies, bosses eventually deal with problems.
    In the best companies, everyone holds everyone else accountable—regardless of
    level or position. The path to high productivity passes not through a static system,
    but through face-to-face conversations

    movements” were the principal force for change, but Zhu immediately dismissed
    this as a false problem. “We are all great men, yes?” “Maybe you are,” muttered
    the person sitting next to Bao. “… what has mattered are the moments of exposure
    in every life, when habit is no longer enough, and choices have to be made. That’s
    when everyone becomes the great man, for a moment; and the choices made in these
    moments, which come all too frequently, then combine to make history. In that
    sense I suppose I come down on the side of the masses, in that it has been a collective
    process, whatever else it is. “Also, this formulation ‘the great man’ of course
    should bring up the question of women; are they included in this description?
    Or should we describe history as being the story of women wresting back the political
    power that they lost with the introduction of agriculture and the creation of
    surplus wealth? Would the gradual and unfinished defeat of patriarchy be the larger
    story of history? Along with, perhaps, the gradual and uncertain defeat of infectious
    disease? So that we have been battling microparasites and macroparasites, eh?
    The bugs and the patriarchs?”

    had been extinguished like a flame. Nirvana, he claimed, was an entirely natural

    love that exists within everyone and everything: maitri (“loving kindness”), the
    desire to bring happiness to all sentient beings; karuna (“compassion”), the resolve
    to liberate all creatures from their pain; mudita (“sympathetic joy”), which takes
    delight in the happiness of others; and finally upeksha (“even-mindedness”), an

    the Christians as for the rabbis, charity was the key to correct exegesis. Saint

    were extremely fast, but even so, trips often took weeks. This was simply too
    much time to be banging around aimlessly; doing that one could easily slide into
    a funk or some other kind of mental hibernation. In the settlements around Saturn
    this sort of thing had sometimes been developed into entire sciences and art forms.
    But any such hebephrenia was dangerous for Wahram, as he had found out long before
    by painful experience. Too often in his past, meaninglessness had gnawed at the
    edges of things. He needed order, and a project; he needed habits. In the nakedness
    of the moments of exfoliation, the intensity of experience had in it a touch of
    terror—terror that no new meaning would blossom to replace the old ones now lost.
    Of course there was no such thing as a true repetition of anything; ever since
    the pre-Socratics that had been clear, Heraclitus and his un-twice-steppable river
    and so on. So habits were not truly iterative, but pseudoiterative. The pattern
    of the day might be the same, in other words, but the individual events fulfilling
    the pattern were always a little bit different. Thus there was both pattern and
    surprise, and this was Wahram’s desired state: to live in a pseudoiterative. But
    then also to live in a good pseudoiterative, an interesting one, the pattern constructed
    as a little work of art. No matter the brevity of a trip, the dullness of the
    terrarium or the people in it, it was important to invent a pattern and a project
    and pursue it with all his will and imagination. It came to this: shipboard life
    was still life. All days had to be seized.'

    This no one could miss. But he realized now that he had been making the assumption
    that the people who involved themselves in governance were making a good-faith
    effort to run things in a rational manner, with a view to the long-term well-being
    of humanity and its biophysical support system. Desmond laughed at him as he tried
    to express this, and irritably he exclaimed, “But why else take on such compromised
    work, if not to that end?” “Power,” Desmond said. “Power and gain.” “Ah.” Sax
    had always been so uninterested in those things that it was hard for him to understand
    why anyone else would be. What was personal gain but the freedom to do what you
    wanted to do? And what was power but the freedom to do what you wanted to do?
    And once you had that freedom, any more wealth or power actually began to restrict
    one’s options, and reduce one’s freedom. One became a servant of one’s wealth
    or power, constrained to spend all one’s time protecting it. So that properly
    seen, the freedom of a scientist with a lab at his command was the highest freedom
    possible. Any more wealth and power only interfered with that. Desmond was shaking
    his head as Sax described this philosophy. “Some people like to tell others what
    to do. They like that more than freedom. Hierarchy, you know. And their place
    in the hierarchy. As long as it’s high enough. Everyone bound into their places.
    It’s safer than freedom. And a lot of people are cowards.”

    EVAs in space and I thought we did really well in the pool. But in the debrief,
    after I’d explained my rationale for tethering my body in a particular way so
    I’d be stable enough to perform a repair, one of our instructors announced to
    the room, “When Chris talks, he has a very clear and authoritative manner—but
    don’t let yourself be lulled into a feeling of complete confidence that he’s right.
    Yes, he used to be a spacewalking instructor and evaluator and he’s Mr. EVA, but
    he hasn’t done a walk since 2001. There have been a lot of changes since then.
    I don’t want the junior trainers to ignore that little voice inside and not question
    something just because it’s being said with authority by someone who’s been here
    a long time.” At first that struck me as a little insulting, because the message
    boiled down to this: “Mr. EVA” sounds like he knows what he’s doing, but really,
    he may not have a clue. Then I stopped to ask myself, “Why is the instructor saying
    that?” Pretty quickly I had to concede that the point was valid. I don’t come
    off as wishy-washy and I’m used to teaching others how to do things, so I can
    sound very sure of myself. That doesn’t mean I think I know everything there is
    to know; I’d always assumed that people understood that perfectly well and felt
    free to jump in and question my judgment. But maybe my demeanor was making that
    difficult. I decided to test that proposition: instead of waiting for feedback,
    I’d invite it and see what happened. After a sim, I began asking my trainers and
    crewmates, “How did I fall short, technically, and what changes could I make next
    time?” Not surprisingly, the answer was rarely, “Don’t change a thing, Chris—everything
    you do is perfect!” So the debrief did what it was supposed to: it alerted me
    to a subtle but important issue I was able to address in a way that ultimately
    improved our crew’s chances of success.'

    never quite seem to figure that out and, in true tortoise-and-hare fashion, find
    themselves in a place they never expected to be: the back of the pack. They don’t
    know how to push themselves to the point of discomfort and beyond. Typically,
    they also don’t recognize their own weaknesses and are therefore reluctant to

  content: 'I have picked two sectors of society where the call for change and reform
    has been shouting in our ears for decades with little to show for it: health care
    and education. These are also service industries, which is where most of us work
    these days. Both of these fields are in the throes of the language of reform.
    But most reform efforts are more about improvement rather than rethinking something
    more fundamental. The health care “reform” is mostly about cost control, who pays,
    and increasing the pressure on standardization. There is no reform in that conversation,
    just better or different management. Real reform in health care will come from
    changing our relationship with our service provider and having service providers
    change their relationship with each other. In consulting terms, we need more balanced
    contracting, more joint discovery, and a new dialogue. This is starting to occur,
    and Chapter Twelve presents a great example from a very special surgeon, Paul
    Uhlig. Like health care, the current conversation about education reform is also
    not reform; it is just more controls and imposed standards masquerading as reform.
    True reform will shift our thinking about the culture of the classroom, accountability
    of the learner, and the relationship between teacher and student. An example of
    this from an amazing high school teacher, Ward Mailliard, is in Chapter Eighteen.'

  content: 'What needs reaffirmation in this edition of the book is that teams and
    personal relationships are still critical to technical and business success. The
    value of teams and relationships is now more widely accepted than it was in the
    past, at least intellectually. We may not be any better at working together, but
    at least we know it matters and want to create more cooperative workplaces, whether
    virtual or in person. One reason the ideas in this book have endured is not so
    much that specific consulting skills are presented in such overconfident specificity;
    it is more because of the attention the book gives to the emotional and personal
    dimensions of our workplaces. Even now, with all the rhetoric given to relationships,
    personal development, and even spirituality, our institutions still operate as
    if strategy, structure, and technology are what really matter. Relationships continue
    to be treated as a necessary inconvenience—as if they have to be endured and wherever
    there is an opportunity to automate a transaction or communicate electronically,
    we take it. In 2000 most telephone conversations involved a machine on one end;
    now it is text messages, e-mail, and, if I want to look personal, Facebook, LinkedIn,
    and their successors. These are often the media of choice. Even more, we encourage
    people to work at home, where human interaction is minimized in the name of serenity
    and a more balanced life. What is difficult about managing relationships is that
    something is demanded of us that technology and automated routines do not require:
    the need to know ourselves and be authentic. Authenticity is simply being honest
    with ourselves and being direct and honest with others. For whatever the reason,
    authenticity continues to be rare in our workplaces. Most interactions carry an
    element of role play, positioning, and strategy. All are reflections of our wish
    to control our environment and the people in it. In some ways, this book is a
    long and detailed description of the landscape of authenticity. What has stood
    the test of time is that this rare act is not only good for the soul but also
    works very well. “Authentic consultant” is not an oxymoron but a compelling competitive
    advantage, if, unfortunately, a rare one. What is still difficult about authenticity
    is that it is a high-risk strategy. It swims upstream in a culture of control,
    which is where most of our organizations remain. It also demands some faith in
    ourselves: we have to be tuned into the feeling dimension of our connection with
    others. Most of us have spent our days developing our brain and have left our
    body and its feeling parts behind, to be reclaimed after work hours. So even when
    we decide to risk being authentic, we might not know how. Valuing the relationship
    between consultant and client, or teacher and student, or service provider and
    customer, and defining how to manage that relationship is where this book has
    found its niche. The intent of this revision is to deepen and expand that white
    space between strategy, structure, and technology that we label relationship.'

    a list of the consulting competencies required to complete the business of contracting.
    You should be able to Ask direct questions about who the client is and who the
    less visible parties to the contract are. Elicit the client’s expectations of
    you. Clearly and simply state what you want from the client. Say no or postpone
    a project that in your judgment has less than a 50/50 chance of success. Probe
    directly for the client’s underlying concerns about losing control. Probe directly
    for the client’s underlying concerns about exposure and vulnerability. Give direct
    verbal support and affirmation to the client. When the contracting meeting is
    not going well, discuss directly with the client why it is not. More detailed
    competencies will surface as we work through a contracting meeting in the next
    chapter. This list, however, contains the crucial ones, which many of us have
    a hard time doing. The hard time we have is not really with the action itself,
    but with valuing the importance of these actions. Having direct discussions with
    the client—about control, vulnerability, your wants, the chance of success, and
    how the discussion is going—makes the difference between an average contracting
    meeting and an excellent one. The problem is that it is possible to have a contracting
    meeting in which none of these subjects are

  content: The reason consultants feel as if they are the victim of the resistance
    is that the client’s discomfort is being expressed indirectly. If the client were
    able to be authentic and put the concern directly into words by saying—”I am concerned
    I am losing control of this group,” or “I feel I am ill equipped to handle this
    particular situation,” or “People expect things from me that I just can’t deliver”—we
    consultants would not feel attacked. We would feel very supportive toward the
    manager. The manager’s direct expression of underlying concerns is not resistance.
    Resistance occurs only when the concerns about facing the difficult realities
    and the choice not to deal with them are expressed indirectly. They are expressed
    indirectly by blaming lack of detailed data, not enough time, impracticality,
    not enough budget, lack of understanding by “those people,” and so on, as the
    reasons not to proceed with a project or implement some recommendations.

    the most difficult clients. They need to change the most and are least able to
    do it. For low-performing organizations, the tension of failure is so high that
    they are unable to take one more risk, and so instead they hold on to their unsatisfactory
    performance. In these extreme cases, there is probably not much consultants can
    do to surface the resistance to change. We may just have to accept it. OGRES AND
    ANGELS In any organization, there are certain managers who are well known for
    their disdain for support groups and internal consultants.

    have added any particularly new capability to the FormLetter class.1 These two
    methods, however they are implemented, simply expose an existing feature of the
    FormLetter class in a slightly different package. So why should we bother? We
    bother because our users asked us to bother. If you reread my tale of intrigue
    and junk mail, you’ll see that it was the coders who were using the FormLetter
    class that asked for the convenience methods. Those methods make the code generating
    the form letters cleaner and easier for the people who count—the programmers who
    need to deal with it. One of the key values of the Ruby programming culture is
    that the look of the code matters. It matters because the people who use the code,
    read the code, and maintain the code matter. Good software engineering is all
    about making everyone’s job easier, not just because we want to go home on time
    but because we all want to turn out the best possible end product. So we add convenience
    methods, build method_missing methods, and go to enormous lengths to make our
    APIs easy to use because programmers with easy-to-use APIs tend to have the time
    to craft easy-to-use—and working—systems.

    passages,3 here are some signposts that can help. First, keep your goal firmly
    in mind. In our example, we wanted to make it easy to add paragraph-generating
    methods to StructuredDocument subclasses. Second, know when things happen. For
    example, when you load the StructuredDocument code, perhaps with this: require
    ''structured_document'' You end up with the generic StructuredDocument class,
    which has the paragraph_type class method on it. A bit later (perhaps even on
    the very next line of code) you load the Instructions class: require ''instructions''
    As the Instructions class definition is getting executed, it will fire off calls
    to the paragraph_type method up in the StructuredDocument class. This will add
    methods with names like introduction, warning, and step to the Instructions class.
    Only when all of this defining is over do you make an instance of Instructions
    and call the generated methods. The third thing to know is that the value of self

    also hope to win the war. We hope that right and goodness will triumph, and that
    when the war is won, we shall have a better world. And we work toward that end.

    a large beverage company. He convinced the VP of that division that more conflict
    was necessary on the team. Unfortunately, they were having a hard time getting
    people to engage in it. This is typical. So the VP put in place two formal rules.
    First, if people remained silent during discussions, he would interpret that as
    disagreement. People quickly realized that if they didn’t weigh in, a decision
    could not be made. Second, at the end of every discussion, the VP would go around
    the room and ask every member of his team for a formal commitment to the decision.
    These simple rules changed the nature of their meetings and increased healthy
    conflict almost immediately. This would not have happened had the VP simply told
    his team that they should engage in more conflict.

  content: First, when accountability is handled during a meeting, every member of
    the team receives the message simultaneously and doesn’t have to make the same
    mistakes in order to learn the lesson of the person being held accountable. Second,
    they know that the leader is holding their colleague accountable, which avoids
    their wondering whether the boss is doing his job. Finally, it serves to reinforce
    the culture of accountability, which increases the likelihood that team members
    will do the same for one another. When leaders—and peers—limit their accountability
    discussions to private conversations, they leave people wondering whether those
    discussions are happening. This often leads to unproductive hallway conversations
    and conjecture about who knows what about whom. Having said all that, when it
    comes to addressing relatively serious issues, or matters of corrective action
    in which a leader is wondering whether a member of the team might not be worthy
    to be on the team anymore, then everything changes. These are best handled privately,
    in a one-on-one situation, to respect the dignity of the person being held accountable.
    However, and this can be dicey, the leader is often well advised to let her people
    know that she is addressing the situation to avoid unproductive and dangerous
    speculation.

  content: There is a darn good chance that your company—in fact, any given company—has
    not yet identified its purpose. I’ve found that most have not, at least not adequately.
    And I’ve come to realize that even organizations that think they have usually
    haven’t done so with the degree of rigor and specificity that is necessary. This
    leads to two problems. First, those teams don’t achieve a real sense of collective
    commitment from their members. Too often busy executives who want nothing to do
    with what they see as ethereal, metaphysical conversations simply nod their heads
    and agree with whatever the team comes up with for a statement of purpose. This
    is a recipe for jargony, empty declarations. Second, and this is certainly related,
    those executives don’t see the company’s reason for existing as having any practical
    implications for the way they make decisions and run the organization. As a result
    of having no real idealistic boundaries, they operate in a largely reactive, shortsighted
    way, being overly tactical and opportunistic. And they often lose their way by
    getting involved in a variety of random pursuits and projects that might be financially
    justifiable in the short term but don’t really fit together. This tends to dilute
    the focus and passion that employees look for when they’re coming to work. Some
    executives, especially those who are a little cynical about all this purpose stuff,
    will say that their company exists simply to make money for owners or shareholders.
    That is almost never a purpose, but rather an important indicator of success.
    It’s how an organization knows that it is effectively fulfilling its purpose,
    but it falls far short of providing the organization with a guide to what ultimately
    matters most. In those rare companies where business owners really do believe
    that the organization’s underlying purpose is to provide themselves with financial
    windfalls, it is best that leaders are up front about that purpose. Otherwise
    they’ll create confusion, cynicism, and a sense of betrayal among employees who
    almost always prefer a more idealistic reason for coming to work.

  content: The fact is that the best human systems are often the simplest and least
    sophisticated ones. Their primary purpose is not to avoid lawsuits or emulate
    what other companies are doing but rather to keep managers and employees focused
    on what the organization believes is important. That’s why a one-page, customized
    performance review form that managers embrace and take seriously is always better
    than a seven-page, sophisticated one designed by an organizational psychologist
    from the National Institute for Human Transformation and Bureaucracy (there is
    no such thing). This point cannot be overstated. Human systems are tools for reinforcement
    of clarity. They give an organization a structure for tying its operations, culture,
    and management together, even when leaders aren’t around to remind people. And
    because each company is different, there are no generic systems that can be downloaded
    from the Internet. Let’s take a quick look at the most important human systems
    that an organization needs, according to the logical life cycle of an employee.
    RECRUITING AND HIRING Bringing the right people into an organization, and keeping
    the wrong ones out, is as important as any activity that a leadership team must
    oversee. Though few leaders will dispute this, not many organizations are good
    at doing it, for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, too many organizations
    have not defined exactly what the right and wrong people look like; that is, they
    haven’t clarified a meaningful set of behavioral values that they can use to screen
    potential employees. I addressed this when I discussed core values, but it’s worth
    repeating. Hiring without clear and strict criteria for cultural fit greatly hampers
    the potential for success of any organization. And even for organizations that
    have identified the right set of behavioral values, a host of other problems keep
    many of them from hiring well. For all the talk about hiring for fit, there is
    still too much emphasis on technical skills and experience when it comes to interviewing
    and selection. And this happens at all levels. When push comes to shove, most
    executives get enamored with what candidates know and have done in their careers
    and allow those things to overshadow more important behavioral issues. They don’t
    seem to buy into the notion that you can teach skill but not attitude. And even
    organizations that have defined their core values and really do believe that those
    values should trump everything else sometimes lose their way when it comes to
    ensuring cultural fit because they don’t have the right kind of process for hiring.
    I’ve found that most companies fall into one of two categories on opposite sides
    of the structural scale for hiring.

    They did not eliminate the sizable, expensive computer; they made it possible
    for the likes of IBM to produce machines of increased speed and capability and
    still make handsome profits without raising prices much. At the same time, the
    development of chips fostered an immense and rapid growth of other kinds of computing
    machines. After mainframes, as the big computers were known, came the cheaper
    and less powerful minicomputers. Then the semiconductor firms contributed the
    microprocessor, the central works of a computer executed on a chip. For a while,
    the three classifications really did describe a company’s products and define
    its markets, but then mainframers and microcomputer companies started making minis
    and minicomputer companies added micros and things that looked like mainframes
    to their product lines. Meanwhile, a host of frankly imitative enterprises started
    making computers and gear for computers that could be plugged right into systems
    built around the wares of the big successful companies. These outfits went by
    the names of “plug compatibles” and “third-party peripheral manufacturers”; those
    who lost some business to them called them “knockoff companies.” Probably they
    helped maintain competition in prices. Many “software” houses sprang up, to write
    programs that would make all those computers actually do work. Many customers,
    such as the Department of Defense, wanted to buy complete systems, all put together
    and ready to run with the turn of a key; hence the rise of companies known as
    original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs—they’d buy gear from various companies
    and put it together in packages. Some firms made computer systems for hospitals;
    some specialized in graphics—computers that draw pictures—and others worked on
    making robots. It became apparent that communications and computing served each
    other so intimately that they might actually become the same thing; IBM bought
    a share in a satellite, and that other nation-state, AT&T, the phone company,
    started making machines that looked suspiciously like computers. Conglomerates,
    of which Exxon was only the largest, seemed determined to buy up every small computer
    firm they could. As for those who observed the activity, they constituted an industry
    in themselves. Trade publications flourished; they bore names such as Datamation,
    Electronic News, Byte, Computermania. IBM, one executive of a mainframe company
    once said, represented not competition but “the environment,” and on Wall Street
    and elsewhere some people made a business solely out of attempting to predict
    what the environment would do next. I once asked a press agent for a computer
    company what was the reason for all this enthusiasm. He held a hand before my
    face and rubbed his thumb across his fingers. “Money,” he whispered solemnly.
    “There’s so goddamn much money to be made.” Examples of spectacular success abounded.
    The industry saw some classic dirty deals and some notable failures, too. RCA
    and Xerox lost about a billion dollars apiece and GE about half a billion making
    computers. It was a gold rush. IBM set up two main divisions, each one representing
    the other’s main competition. Other companies did not have to invent competitors
    and did somewhat more of their contending externally. Some did sometimes use illicit
    tools. Currying favor, seeking big orders for chips, some salesmen of semiconductors,
    for instance, were known for whispering to one computer maker news about another
    computer maker’s latest unannounced product. Firms fought over patents, marketing
    practices and employees, and once in a while someone would get caught stealing
    blueprints or other documents, and for these and other reasons computer companies
    often went to court. IBM virtually resided there. Everyone sued IBM, it seemed.
    The biggest suit, the Jarndyce v. Jarndyce of the industry, involved the Justice
    Department’s attempt to break up IBM. Virtually an entire large law firm was created
    to defend IBM in this case, which by 1980 had run ten years and had been in continuous
    trial for several. Data General took its place in this bellicose land of opportunity
    in 1968, as a “minicomputer company.” By the end of 1978 this increasingly undescriptive
    term could in some senses be applied to about fifty companies. Their principal
    but by no means their only business, the manufacture and sale of small computers,
    had grown spectacularly—from about $150 million worth of shipments in 1968, to
    about $3.5 billion worth by 1978—and it would continue to grow, most interested
    parties believed, at the rate of about 30 percent a year. By 1978 Data General
    ranked third in sales of minicomputers and stood among the powers in this segment
    of the industry. The leader was Digital Equipment Corporation, or DEC, as it is
    usually called. DEC produced some of the first minicomputers, back in the early
    sixties. Data General was the son, emphatically the son, of DEC. A chapter of
    DEC’s official history, a technical work that the company published, describes
    the making of a computer called the PDP-8. DEC sent this machine to market in
    1965. It was a hit. It made DEC’s first fortune. The PDP-8, says the official
    history, “established the concept of minicomputers, leading the way to a multibillion
    dollar industry.” But the book doesn’t say that Edson de Castro, then an engineer
    in his twenties, led the team that designed the PDP-8. The technical history mentions
    de Castro only once, briefly, and in another context. They expunged de Castro.
    In 1968 de Castro and two other young engineers seceded from DEC. Several completely
    different versions of their flight exist and have by now acquired the impenetrable
    quality of myth. Did they quit because, after long and heartfelt labor on a new
    design, they found that DEC’s management would not build their new machine? DEC’s
    management did turn down a new design of de Castro’s, and afterward, along with
    a man from another company named Herb Richman, de Castro and the two other engineers
    from Digital incorporated Data General and started building their own minicomputer.
    But did they design this new machine after they seceded, or had they done that
    job in secret, using DEC’s facilities, while still on DEC’s payroll? One version
    of the story suggested the latter. More than ten years later, DEC’s founder and
    president would tell reporters from Fortune, “What they did was so bad we’re still
    upset about it.” But DEC never sued Data General’s founders, and clearly there
    were other reasons why Digital might have become upset. For within a year, de
    Castro and company had set up shop in DEC’s own territory and had started raking
    in the loot. They rented space in what had been a beauty parlor, in the former
    mill town of Hudson, Massachusetts. Practically all that remains of that time
    is a black-and-white photograph of this first headquarters. In the foreground
    stand four young men with short hair, wearing white shirts and skinny ties and
    the sort of plain black shoes that J. Edgar Hoover’s men favored. They are engaged
    in what is obviously meant to look like routine conversation. The linoleum floor,
    the metal furniture, evoke motor vehicle departments, and the youths in the picture
    could be members of some junior chamber of commerce, playing capitalists for a
    day. Not shown in this bemusing picture is the shrewd and somewhat older lawyer
    from a large New York firm who helped Data General’s founders raise their capital
    and who became a crucial member of their team. What also doesn’t show is the fact
    that some of these young men were already computer engineers of no mean repute—their
    age in this case was no impediment, for computer engineers like athletes often
    blossom early. They started Data General at an auspicious time. In the late 1960s,
    the period memorialized in John Brooks’s The Go-Go Years, venture capital (among
    other things) abounded, and although they started out with only $800,000, more
    lay in reserve. They also entered a good territory for fledglings. They could
    not have dreamed of moving in on IBM’s markets without truly vast amounts of capital.
    But the people who bought minicomputers—engineers, scientists, and, mainly, purchasing
    agents of OEMs—understood the machines. A new manufacturer could reach them through
    relatively inexpensive ads in the trade journals, and didn’t need to build a service
    organization right away, since these customers could take care of themselves.
    These were also the sorts of customers who could be expected to embrace a newcomer,
    if the price was right; they’d prefer a bargain to a brand name. But around the
    time when Data General established itself in the beauty parlor, other entrepreneurs
    were starting up minicomputer companies at the rate of about one every three days.
    Only a few of those other new outfits survived the decade, whereas Data General,
    before it had exhausted its first and fairly modest dose of capital, achieved
    and never fell from that state of grace, a positive cash flow.

    public offering of stock, after the company had been making money for a while
    and the stock they’d already issued had done very well indeed, their lawyer insisted
    that each of the founders sell some of their holdings in the company and each
    “take down a million bucks.” This so that they could negotiate without the dread
    of losing everything (“Having to go back to your father’s gas station,” Richman
    called that nightmare). As for the name of the theory behind selling enough stock
    to become millionaires, Richman told me, “I don’t know how you put it in the vernacular.
    We called it the Fuck You Theory.” In the computer business, your market can be
    your fate. Although by the late 1970s it was hard to define a company’s place
    in the industry by the sorts of machines that it made, certain broad historic
    distinctions in ways of doing business still divided a large part of the industry
    into three segments. The differences showed up in the nature of a company’s expenditures.
    IBM and other mainframe companies spent more money selling their products and
    serving their customers than they did in actually building their machines. They
    sold their computers to people who were actually going to use them, not to middlemen,
    and this market required good manners. Microcomputer companies sold equipment
    as if it were corn, in large quantities; they spent most of their money making
    things and competed not by being polite but by being aggressive. Minicomputer

    belief from strong proofs” (fragment 55), but baseness, like beauty and contact
    lenses, is in the eye of the beholder. When scientists across the way refuse to
    grant the force of an argument that its sponsor finds compelling, they are base
    by definition, which is why the most common accusations in science are forms of
    ad hominems—implications of personal failings, like stupidity, sloppy scholarship,
    and often, dishonesty. Personal attacks are far more common in science than is
    generally thought (suggesting, among other things, that thin veils such as x is
    confused, or y fails to understand the issue, or z misrepresents my position actually
    work). Even the parched and stolid pages of professional journals are full of
    them, and they cluster fructiferously around paradigm disputes. It isn’t difficult
    to see why. Most immediately, mudslinging is easy. If you find an observation
    disagreeable, says Hawking, “you can always question the competence of the person
    who carried the observation out” (1988:10)."

    is not a man. It is the Plan. The correct, realistic, exact plan, the one that
    will provide your solution once the problem has been posited clearly, in its entirety,
    in its indispensable harmony. This plan has been drawn up well away from the frenzy
    in the mayor’s office or the town hall, from the cries of the electorate or the
    laments of society’s victims. It has been drawn up by serene and lucid minds.
    It has taken account of nothing but human truths. It has ignored all current regulations,
    all existing usages, and channels. It has not considered whether or not it could
    be carried out with the constitution now in force. It is a biological creation
    destined for human beings and capable of realization by modern techniques.31 The
    wisdom of the plan sweeps away all social obstacles: the elected authorities,
    the voting public, the constitution, and the legal structure. At the very least,
    we are in the presence of a dictatorship of the planner; at most, we approach
    a cult of power and remorselessness that is reminiscent of fascist imagery.'

    to convey her conviction that centralized control is an illusion. As the Russian
    Revolution [1905] shows to us, the mass strike is such a changeable phenomenon
    that it reflects in itself all phases of political and economic struggle, all
    stages and moments of the revolution. Its applicability, its effectiveness, and
    the moments of its origin change continually. It suddenly opens new, broad perspectives
    of revolution just where it seemed to have come to a narrow pass; and it disappoints
    where one thought he could reckon on it in full certitude. Now it flows like a
    broad billow over the whole land, now it divides itself into a gigantic net of
    thin streams; now it bubbles forth from under the ground like a fresh spring,
    now it trickles flat along the ground. … All [forms of popular struggle] run through
    one another, next to each other, across one another, flow in and over one another;
    it is an eternal, moving, changing sea of appearances.71

  content: Kollontay’s point of departure, like Luxemburg’s, is an assumption about
    what kinds of tasks are the making of revolutions and the creating of new forms
    of production. For both of them, such tasks are voyages in uncharted waters. There
    may be some rules of thumb, but there can be no blueprints or battle plans drawn
    up in advance; the numerous unknowns in the equation make a one-step solution
    inconceivable. In more technical language, such goals can be approached only by
    a stochastic process of successive approximations, trial and error, experiment,
    and learning through experience. The kind of knowledge required in such endeavors
    is not deductive knowledge from first principles but rather what Greeks of the
    classical period called métis, a concept to which we shall return. Usually translated,
    inadequately, as “cunning,” métis is better understood as the kind of knowledge
    that can be acquired only by long practice at similar but rarely identical tasks,
    which requires constant adaptation to changing circumstances. It is to this kind
    of knowledge that Luxemburg appealed when she characterized the building of socialism
    as “new territory” demanding “improvisation” and “creativity.” It is to this kind
    of knowledge that Kollontay appealed when she insisted that the party leaders
    were not infallible, that they needed the “everyday experience” and “practical
    work of the basic class collectives” of those “who actually produce and organize
    production at the same time.”87 In an analogy that any Marxist would recognize,
    Kollontay asked whether it was conceivable that the cleverest feudal estate managers
    could have invented early capitalism by themselves. Of course not, she answered,
    because their knowledge and skills were directly tied to feudal production, just
    as the technical specialists of her day had learned their lessons within a capitalist
    framework. There was simply no precedent for the future now being forged. Echoing,
    for rhetorical effect, a sentiment that both Luxemburg and Lenin had uttered,
    Kollontay claimed that “it is impossible to decree communism. It can be created
    only in the process of practical research, through mistakes, perhaps, but only
    by the creative powers of the working class itself.” While specialists and officials
    had a collaborative role of vital importance, “only those who are directly bound
    to industry can introduce into it animating innovations.”88

    it was thought, greatly reduce the unit cost of production.

    provided no evidence that industrial farms were superior to family farms in efficiency
    and profitability. The advantages industrial farms did have over smaller producers
    were of another kind. Their very size gave them an edge in access to credit, political
    influence (relevant to taxes, support payments, and the avoidance of foreclosure),
    and marketing muscle. What they gave away in agility and quality labor they often
    made up for in their considerable political and economic clout.

    tend to “travel” as an abbreviated visual image of efficiency that is less a scientific
    proposition to be tested than a quasi-religious faith in a visual sign or representation
    of order. As Jacobs suggested, they may substitute an apparent visual order for
    the real thing. The fact that they look right becomes more important than whether
    they work; or, better put, the assumption is that if the arrangement looks right,
    it will also, ipso facto, function well. The importance of such representations
    is manifested in a tendency to miniaturize, to create such microenvironments of
    apparent order as model villages, demonstration projects, new capitals, and so
    on.

    mass exercises—thousands of bodies moving in perfect unison according to a meticulously
    rehearsed script. When such coordination is achieved, the spectacle may have several
    effects. The demonstration of mass coordination, its designers hope, will awe
    spectators and participants with its display of powerful cohesion. The awe is
    enhanced by the fact that, as in the Taylorist factory, only someone outside and
    above the display can fully appreciate it as a totality; the individual participants
    at ground level are small molecules within an organism whose brain is elsewhere.
    The image of a nation that might operate along these lines is enormously flattering
    to elites at the apex—and, of course, demeaning to a population whose role they
    thus reduce to that of ciphers. Beyond impressing observers, such displays may,
    in the short run at least, constitute a reassuring self-hypnosis which serves
    to reinforce the moral purpose and self-confidence of the elites.

  content: A progressive loss of experimental control occurs when one moves from the
    laboratory to the research plot on an experimental station and then to field trials
    on actual farms. Richards notes the unease such a move aroused among researchers
    in West Africa, who were anxious about making their research more practical yet
    concerned about any relaxing of experimental conditions. After discussing how
    the farms selected for trials ought to be relatively homogeneous so that they
    would respond in uniform ways to the experimental results, the researchers went
    on to lament the experimental control that they they lost by leaving the research
    station. “It may be difficult,” they wrote, “to plant at all locations within
    a few days and almost impossible to find farm plots of uniform soil.” They continued,
    “Other types of interference, such as pest attacks or bad weather, may affect
    some treatments and not others.”79 This is, Richards explains, a “salutary reminder
    of one of the reasons why ‘formal’ scientific research procedures on experimental
    stations, with the stress on controlling all variables except the one or two under
    direct investigation, ‘miss the point’ as far as many small-holders are concerned.
    The main concern of farmers is how to cope with these complex interactions and
    unscheduled events. From the scientist’s point of view (particularly in relation
    to the need to secure clear-cut results for publication), on-farm experimentation
    poses a tough challenge.”80

    in the United States was clearly outlined by a rogue economist testifying to Congress
    in 1972. Only in the past decade has serious attention been given to the fact
    that the large agricultural firm is … able to achieve benefits by externalizing
    certain costs. The disadvantages of large scale operation fall largely outside
    the decision-making framework of the large farm firm. Problems of waste disposal,
    pollution control, added burdens on public service, deterioration of rural social
    structures, impairment of the tax base, and the political consequences of a concentration
    of economic power have typically not been considered as costs of large scale,
    by the firm. They are unquestionably costs to the larger community. In theory,
    large scale operation should enable the firm to bring a wide range of both costs
    and benefits within its internal decision-making framework. In practice the economic
    and political power that accompanies large scale provides constant temptation
    to the large firm to take the benefits and pass on the costs.87 In other words,
    although the business analysts of the agricultural firms have weak peripheral
    vision, the political clout that such firms possess both individually and collectively
    can help them avoid being blindsided.

    The views of the peasantry in all countries are worthy of respect; there is always
    good reason for their practices; in matters like the cultivation of mixed crops
    they themselves are still the pioneers.”109 Howard credits most of his own findings
    about soil, humus, and root action to a careful observation of indigenous farming
    practice. And he is rather disdainful of agricultural specialists who “do not

  content: Looking at technology as practice, indeed as formalized practice, has some
    quite interesting consequences. One is that it links technology directly to culture,
    because culture, after all, is a set of socially accepted practices and values.
    Well laid down and agreed upon practices also define the practitioners as a group
    of people who have something in common because of the way they are doing things.
    Out of this notion of unifying practice springs the historical definition of “us”
    and “them.” I think it is important to realize that the experience of common practice
    is one of the ways in which people define themselves as groups and set themselves
    apart from others. “Around here, that’s how we do things,” a group will say, and
    this is their way of self-identification, because “others” may do the same thing
    differently. A different way of doing something, a different tool for the same
    task, separates the outsider from the insider.

    can be truly isolated from its general context. This is why its first triumphs
    came in the study of astronomy. On the other hand, the application of the general
    to the specific has been much less successful in situations where generalization
    was achieved only by omitting essential considerations of context. These questions
    of reductionism, of loss of context, and of cultural biases are cited quite frequently
    by critics of the scientific method.4 We hear much less about the human and social
    effects of the separation of knowledge from experience that is inherent in any
    scientific approach. These effects are quite widespread and I think they can be
    serious and debilitating from a human point of view.

    about two decades ago as leaders began to understand the downside of disciplining
    to ‘fix’ errors—and the upside of instead conducting a thorough evaluation of
    the ‘why’ behind those errors. Even repetitive errors are usually the result of
    something other than a technician’s negligence. A striking example of this occurred
    when, over a six-year period, ‘hundreds of mechanics were cited for logbook violations.
    People working the aircraft on the gate were under pressure and they’d screw up
    the paperwork.’ Violations meant suspensions or a fine. Then the airline wanted
    to print 50,000 new logbooks. Starting with the station that had most problems,
    it asked the mechanics to design the pages. They did. Another station made a few
    tweaks, and when the new logbooks were introduced, violations dropped to zero.
    The problem wasn’t negligent mechanics, it was a poorly designed logbook.

    have been involved in an incident that (potentially) hurt or killed someone else
    (for example, passengers, bystanders) and for which they feel personally responsible.
    Strong social and organizational support systems for second victims (psychological
    first aid, debriefings, follow-up), have proven critical to contain the negative
    consequences (particularly post-traumatic stress in all its forms). Implementing
    and maintaining support systems takes resources, but it is an investment not only
    in worker health and retention—it is an investment in justice and safety too.
    Justice can come from acknowledging that the practitioner is a victim too—a second
    victim. For some it can be empowering to be part of an investigation process.
    The opportunity to recount experiences first-hand can be healing—if these are
    taken seriously and do not expose the second victim to potential retribution or
    other forms of jeopardy. Such involvement of second victims is an important organizational
    investment in safety and learning. The resilience of second victims and the organization
    are intricately intertwined, after all. The lived experience of a second victim
    represents a rich trove of data for how safety is made and broken at the very
    heart of the organization. Those accounts can be integrated in how an individual
    and an organization handle their risk and safety.

    contractors), to work the way they expect? • What do your people believe is “dodgy”
    about the operation? Ask them that question directly, and you may get some surprising
    results. • What do your people have to do to “finish the design” of the tools
    and technologies that the organization has given them to work with? Finishing
    the design may be obvious from little post-it notes with reminders for particular
    switches or settings, or more “advanced” jury-rigged solutions (like an upside-down
    paper coffee cup on the flap handle of the 60-million dollar jet I flew, so as
    to not forget to set the flaps under certain circumstances). Such finishing the
    design can be a marker of resilience: people adapt their tools and technologies
    to forestall or contain the risks they know about. But it can also be a pointer
    to places where your system may be more brittle than you think. • How often do
    your people have to say to each other: “here’s how to make it work” when they
    discuss a particular technology or portion of your operation? What is the informal
    teaching and “coaching” that is going on in order to make that happen?'

    the ceiling as if for the word, “… you say, ‘altruism.’ This is a question in
    your animal studies. Does true altruism exist, and is it a good adaptation? Does
    compassion work, in other words? You have done studies that suggest altruism is
    the best adaptive strategy, if seen from the group context. This then becomes
    a kind of … admonishment. To practice compassion in order to successfully evolve—this,
    coming from your science, which claims to be descriptive only! Only describing
    what has worked to make us what we are. But in Buddhism we have always said, if
    you want to help others, practice compassion; if you want to help yourself, practice
    compassion. Now science adds, if you want to help your species, practice compassion.”
    This got a laugh, and Frank also chuckled. He started to think about it in terms
    of prisoners’ dilemma strategies; it was an invocation for all to make the always
    generous move, for maximum group return, indeed maximum individual return.… Thus
    he missed what Drepung said next, absorbed in something more like a feeling than
    a thought: If only I could believe in something, no doubt it would be a relief.
    All his rationality, all his acid skepticism; suddenly it was hard not to feel
    that it was really just some kind of disorder. And at that very moment Rudra Cakrin
    looked right at him, him alone in all the audience, and Drepung said, “An excess
    of reason is itself a form of madness.” Frank sat back in his seat. What had the
    question been? Rerunning his short-term memory, he could not find it. Now he was
    lost to the conversation again. His flesh was tingling, as if he were a bell that
    had been struck. “The experience of enlightenment can be sudden.” He didn’t hear
    that, not consciously. “The scattered parts of consciousness occasionally assemble
    at once into a whole pattern.” He didn’t hear that either, as he was lost in thought.
    All his certainties were trembling. He thought, an excess of reason itself a form
    of madness—it’s the story of my life. And the old man knew."

    question. Whichever way it was answered, it would leave the consultant out of

    do ineffective consultants. The difference, however, is that when an effective
    consultant is present, the client solves problems.

  content: As compensation for losing the intimacy of dishwashing, the consultant
    gains the satisfaction of a much wider effect on the world's gunk, grease, and
    grime. In the time it would take to wash a hundred mugs, I can advise two other
    people on how to do the job in my absence. What I lose in quality, I gain in quantity.
    As a dishwashing trainer, I intensify the quality/quantity tradeoff, because training
    is merely a cheaper form of consulting. Instead of giving one client my undivided
    attention, I design a workshop that can handle fifteen or twenty. Each participant
    gets a little less, but the cost goes down, so the market for my message expands.
    Sure, a couple will miss some essential point, and may leave their dishes actually
    grungier than before. But isn't it worth it to spread the word? As a dishwashing
    lecturer, I can spread my consulting advice even further, reaching several hundred
    avid clients at one time. True, some of them may be sleeping with their eyes open,
    and a few might even think I said to rub peanut butter on, rather than off. But
    shouldn't I think of the greater good for the greater number? But why stop there?
    Through the twin miracles of the printing press and internet, I can reach hundreds
    of thousands of clients with my sterling advice. If my book on dishwashing is
    a bestseller, I might even reach millions! And earn millions!

    meeting to solve, which ran the risk of using even more time now. I tend to do
    that because I've learned that people underestimate future time when it's something
    that might be unpleasant, like dealing with an angry person. "Maybe it will go
    away" is the attitude, and, of course, sometimes it does. But on the average,
    it seems to pay to invest a little more time now at least to find out how much
    time it will take later. By making the time tradeoff explicit and by indicating
    a willingness to contribute time now, I make it clear that it is a problem of
    limited time, not a problem of limited respect for the other person.

    reduce their daily consumption just by having them write down the time when they
    take a cigarette. These people enjoyed smoking, and didn''t want to give it up,
    but they knew they didn''t enjoy every single cigarette and needed a trigger to
    remind them that they might be taking a cigarette unconsciously. I generally advise
    them to get a special cigarette case in which they can keep a tally card for writing
    the times. After keeping the tally for a week, they have not only reduced their
    smoking, but are enjoying it more when they do smoke. They''ve also transferred
    the trigger to the case itself and can dispense with keeping the tally. We''ve
    used the tally card with similar success on many other habitual problems. To alter
    the habit of interrupting other people, I advise clients to keep a record of the
    time of each interruption and whom they are interrupting. To reduce the tendency
    to waste time on the telephone, I have them keep a list of whom they spoke to,
    what time they started, and what time they finished. In each of these cases, there''s
    no requirement to do anything about the habit, except to gather information. Some
    people find that the habit isn''t as bad as they feared: Their trouble wasn''t
    the habit, but how they felt about it.'

  content: 'of meeting. If I can improve a client''s meeting-effectiveness, my consulting
    task is simplified, and the client retains the benefits long after I''ve gone.
    The Hidden Agenda is one of the techniques I use to train people to "see" inside
    others. I use the following technique. Before a meeting begins, I give each participant
    a sheet of paper on which is written a secret personal assignment for that meeting.
    Here are some examples of such secret assignments: • Try to see to it that every
    decision the meeting takes is written down and displayed so all can view it. •
    Make sure that every person gets a chance to talk on every topic. • Do not let
    any single person or clique dominate the meeting. • Pretend that you have not
    prepared for this meeting, and try to conceal that fact from everyone else throughout
    the entire meeting. • If at all possible, see that the meeting comes to decision
    X without letting yourself be identified with that decision. The typical secret
    assignment describes something that people normally do in meetings, with some
    assignments having a positive effect, some negative, and some neutral. By playing
    the role explicitly, the actor learns to "see" behavior that was previously invisible,
    or to see alternative interpretations for behavior that was previously visible.
    This new vision inevitably affects a person''s future understanding of meetings.
    Two secret assignments I frequently use are these: • Pretend you have another
    meeting to attend following this one. You very much want to attend that meeting,
    so do everything you can to make this meeting end as quickly as possible. • Pretend
    you have another meeting to attend following this one. You very much want to miss
    that meeting, which you can do if this one runs overtime. Do everything you can
    to make this meeting last as long as possible. By using both of these secret assignments
    in the same meeting, I make it possible for everyone to see how the conflict works
    out. At the end of the meeting, I post a list of the secret assignments, and ask
    the observers to guess who had which. Without fail, the person assigned the "quick
    meeting" agenda is misidentified as the "prolonged meeting" person!'

    of your task and will have the following characteristics: • Your task is to influence
    people, but only at their request. • You strive to make people less dependent
    on you, rather than more dependent. • You try to obey The Law of the Jiggle: The
    less you actually intervene, the better you feel about your work. • If your clients
    want help in solving problems, you are able to say no. • If you say yes but fail,
    you can live with that. If you succeed, the least satisfying approach is when
    you solve the problem for them. • More satisfying is to help them solve their
    problems in such a way that they will be more likely to solve the next problem
    without help. • Most satisfying is to help them learn how to prevent problems
    in the first place. • You can be satisfied with your accomplishments, even if
    clients don''t give you credit. • Your ideal form of influence is first to help
    people see their world more clearly, and then to let them decide what to do next.
    • Your methods of working are always open for display and discussion with your
    clients. • Your primary tool is merely being the person you are, so your most
    powerful method of helping other people is to help yourself.'

    itself has the intrinsic quality of gravity, rather than saying that gravity is
    part of a system of forces acting on the rock. In the same way, when we talk about
    others, we talk about their inherent properties, rather than see those properties
    in relation to the external environment. In fact, it’s those interactions with
    our environment that drive our behavior. It’s the system that surrounds us, rather
    than any intrinsic quality, that accounts for the vast majority of our behavior.
    What Scrum is designed to do is change that system. Instead of looking for blame
    and fault, it rewards positive behavior by focusing people on working together
    and getting things done.

  content: With a long historical perspective, it seems clear that when the meetings
    get boring, we have taken a step forward. Boring meetings mean that the radical
    has become mainstream, and that the establishment has changed its mind about the
    very nature of right and wrong. The struggles for bans on child labor, or for
    fire exits or minimum wage or factory codes of conduct, are never boring. But
    when the fight is won, the meetings get boring. While the battle rages for and
    against, it is interesting. But when the battle is over and the fight is no longer
    about whether to have fire exits but where to put them, not whether to have a
    minimum wage, but how to administer it, not whether to disclose factory locations
    but by what means and how often—when the establishment has changed its mind and
    we are just working out the details in (yet another) early morning committee meeting—it
    gets boring.

    life on the farm. I would tell her that the poor suffer more from exclusion from
    politics than from the perils of the market, and that if she has activist energy
    left over it should be focused on including people in politics rather than shielding
    them from markets. And I would tell her about the shoulders she stands on, about
    her own sisters and brothers in time and the noble family tree of activists, and
    the difference they have made in a day's life at work all over the world. I would
    tell her that, in just a few short years, I have seen the difference her own generation
    has made, and that someday people will stand on her shoulders, too. I would tell
    her that Nike, Adidas, and GAP need her to keep watching, and so do Wal-Mart and
    the Chinese government. I would tell her that I have met dozens of seamstresses
    in Chinese factories who need her, and that future generations of sweatshop workers
    and cotton farmers need her as well. I would tell her to look both ways, but to
    march on.

    work. Having machines to help them, human beings can create more output. But in
    both widget manufacturing and administrative work, something else can also increase
    the productivity of the black box. This is called work simplification. To get
    leverage this way, you first need to create a flow chart of the production process
    as it exists. Every single step must be shown on it; no step should be omitted
    in order to pretty things up on paper. Second, count the number of steps in the
    flow chart so that you know how many you started with. Third, set a rough target
    for reduction of the number of steps. In the first round of work simplification,
    our experience shows that you can reasonably expect a 30 to 50 percent reduction.

    timely information. What they do is constitute an archive of data, help to validate
    ad hoc inputs, and catch, in safety-net fashion, anything you may have missed.
    But reports also have another totally different function. As they are formulated
    and written, the author is forced to be more precise than he might be verbally.
    Hence their value stems from the discipline and the thinking the writer is forced
    to impose upon himself as he identifies and deals with trouble spots in his presentation.
    Reports are more a medium of self-discipline than a way to communicate information.
    Writing the report is important; reading it often is not.

    of seemingly comparable significance the one or two or three that provide leverage
    well beyond the others and concentrate on them. For me, paying close attention
    to customer complaints constitutes a high-leverage activity. Aside from making
    a customer happy, the pursuit tends to produce important insights into the workings
    of my own operation. Such complaints may be numerous, and though all of them need
    to be followed up by someone, they don’t all require or wouldn’t all benefit from
    my personal attention. Which one out of ten or twenty complaints to dig into,
    analyze, and follow up is where art comes into the work of a manager. The basis
    of that art is an intuition that behind this complaint and not the other lurk
    many deeper problems.

    carry a raw material inventory in terms of projects. This is not to be confused
    with his work-in-process inventory, because that, like eggs in a continuous boiler,

    of things you need to do but don’t need to finish right away—discretionary projects,

    long term. Without such an inventory of projects, a manager will most probably

    participates by asking questions and making comments. If you avoid the presenter’s
    eyes, yawn, or read the newspaper it’s worse than not being there at all. Lack

    it is dead wrong to force someone in such circumstances out of the company. Instead,
    I think management ought to face up to its own error in judgment and take forthright
    and deliberate steps to place the person into a job he can do. Management should
    also support the employee in the face of the embarrassment that he is likely to
    feel. If recycling is done openly, all will be pleasantly surprised how short-lived

    philosophers for millennia. It was a question that asks: Is the tree that I’m
    seeing in my garden the idea of that tree or the real tree? For a scientist such
    as Humboldt who was trying to understand nature, this was the most important question.
    Humans were like citizens of two worlds, occupying both the world of the Ding
    an sich (the thing-in-itself) which was the external world, and the internal world
    of one’s perception (how things ‘appeared’ to individuals). According to Kant,
    the ‘thing-in-itself’ could never be truly known, while the internal world was
    always subjective. What Kant brought to the table was the so-called transcendental
    level: the concept that when we experience an object, it becomes a ‘thing-as-it-appears-to-us’.
    Our senses as much as our reason are like tinted spectacles through which we perceive
    the world.'

    began to appreciate individual perception and subjectivity. Only a few years previously,
    he had admitted that ‘vivid phantasy confuses me’, but now he came to believe
    that imagination was as necessary as rational thought in order to understand the
    natural world. ‘Nature must be experienced through feeling,’ Humboldt wrote to
    Goethe, insisting that those who wanted to describe the world by simply classifying
    plants, animals and rocks ‘will never get close to it’.

  content: The way entrepreneurs assimilated that environment’s values and came to
    see those values as normal reveals much about why they devoted their lives to
    creating an “extended commerce” in the southwestern United States. They spoke
    as if their own bodies were doing the things that their deals—sales of cotton,
    purchases of land or slaves, payments of money on the other side of the ocean—made
    happen. Yet not their whole bodies. There was one specific part of the body they
    talked as if they were using. They wrote notes and letters that informed their
    correspondents that they held slaves “on hand” and money “in hand.” Important
    letters “came to hand.” They got cotton “off [their] hands” and into the market.
    In 1815, waiting for prices to rise, John Richards offered the Bank of the State
    of Mississippi a note to ensure that he would not yet have to sell “the cotton
    that I now have in hand.” Individual promises-to-pay that drew upon credit with
    other merchants were “notes of hand.”26 Few parts of the body have a more intimate
    and direct connection to the mind than the hands, and when entrepreneurs used
    words to grasp the control ropes of the new economy, they described the sensation
    as if the new world’s powers were held in their own like puppet strings. They
    produced concrete results at distance, using words that their hands wrote on pieces
    of paper. The fingers at the end of the writer’s arm might not actually hold the
    material thing—the bales of cotton, the stacks of coin, the ship whose captain
    and crew were directed to carry them—that the figurative language of trade said
    it grasped. But in a very real sense, the writer controlled these things, these
    people.

  content: historians have repeatedly confused “manhood” and “resistance” when they
    have written about slavery.43 Joe Kilpatrick was no hero. He could not construct
    his life as he would have done in freedom. He was not willing to die just to show
    he had the freedom to die. Yet he did make choices, and the ones he made were
    important both for the beliefs about manhood they reveal and for what they did
    for George Jones, for Lettice, and for Nelly. Instead of honor, Kilpatrick chose
    what Todorov called “ordinary virtues.” Heroes deal out vengeance, wiping out
    insults, and in an existential sense denying their own death. In twentieth-century
    camps, however, Todorov found, some people instead found transcendence by displaying
    kindness toward other people. Through small, everyday acts that committed them
    to the survival of other human beings—even at the cost of lowering their own chances—they
    demonstrated their own commitment to an abstract yet personal value. Although
    heroic acts were as suicidal in twentieth-century death camps as they were in
    nineteenth-century slave labor camps, even in hell there was still room to be
    a moral human being.44 In the slave labor camps of the Southwest, an adult man’s
    commitment to ordinary as opposed to heroic virtues could mean the difference
    between life and death for children like George Jones. Such choices could have
    the same result for the men themselves. Rebuilt blood ties could provide a reason
    not to die fighting in one’s chains. Amid the disruptions and dangers of the 1830s,
    enslaved men frequently became caretakers of others. Caring is not central to
    most definitions of masculinity. But just as the kindness of enslaved men had
    breathed life back into Lucy Thurston’s soul when her spirit was as dead as a
    zombie in that Louisiana cotton field, the kindness of men like Joe Kilpatrick
    led them to create families of all sorts, and to care for them, feed them, and
    teach them. Because these choices placed them in relationships as husbands or
    lovers, fathers or brothers, these men often made ordinary virtues central to
    their own identities, despite all the cultural noise that told them that as men
    they had failed. And perhaps—perhaps—a man who lived in that way also undermined
    the white ideal of the man as vengeful hero.

    up” that has become the hallmark of modern knowledge. Contaminated diversity is
    not only particular and historical, ever changing, but also relational. It has
    no self-contained units; its units are encounter-based collaborations. Without
    self-contained units, it is impossible to compute costs and benefits, or functionality,
    to any “one” involved. No self-contained individuals or groups assure their self-interests
    oblivious to the encounter. Without algorithms based on self-containment, scholars
    and policymakers might have to learn something about the cultural and natural
    histories at stake. That takes time, and too much time, perhaps, for those who
    dream of grasping the whole in an equation. But who put them in charge? If a rush
    of troubled stories is the best way to tell about contaminated diversity, then
    it’s time to make that rush part of our knowledge practices. Perhaps, like the
    war survivors themselves, we need to tell and tell until all our stories of death
    and near-death and gratuitous life are standing with us to face the challenges
    of the present. It is in listening to that cacophony of troubled stories that
    we might encounter our best hopes for precarious survival.

    lie down with the lamb. And organisms don’t just eat each other; they also make
    divergent ecologies. Latent commons are those mutualist and nonantagonistic entanglements
    found within the play of this confusion. Latent commons are not good for everyone.
    Every instance of collaboration makes room for some and leaves out others. Whole
    species lose out in some collaborations. The best we can do is to aim for “good-enough”
    worlds, where “good-enough” is always imperfect and under revision. Latent comments
    don’t institutionalize well. Attempts to turn the commons into policy are commendably
    brave, but they do not capture the effervescence of the latent commons. The latent
    commons moves in law’s interstices; it is catalyzed by infraction, infection,
    inattention—and poaching. Latent commons cannot redeem us. Some radical thinkers
    hope that progress will lead us to a redemptive and utopian commons. In contrast,
    the latent commons is here and now, amidst the trouble. And humans are never fully
    in control. Given this negative character, it makes no sense to crystallize first
    principles or seek natural laws that generate best cases. Instead, I practice
    arts of noticing. I comb through the mess of existing worlds-in-the-making, looking
    for treasures—each distinctive and unlikely to be found again, at least in that
    form.'

    evaluating. It only requires that we maintain a separation between our observations
    and our evaluations. NVC is a process language that discourages static generalizations;
    instead, evaluations are to be based on observations specific to time and context.
    Semanticist Wendell Johnson pointed out that we create many problems for ourselves
    by using static language to express or capture a reality that is ever changing:
    “Our language is an imperfect instrument created by ancient and ignorant men.
    It is an animistic language that invites us to talk about stability and constants,
    about similarities and normal and kinds, about magical transformations, quick
    cures, simple problems, and final solutions. Yet the world we try to symbolize
    with this language is a world of process, change, differences, dimensions, functions,
    relationships, growths, interactions, developing, learning, coping, complexity.
    And the mismatch of our ever-changing world and our relatively static language
    forms is part of our problem.”'

  content: "“The public peace—the sidewalk and street peace—of cities is not kept
    primarily by the police, necessary as police are. It is kept primarily by an intricate,
    almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards among the people
    themselves, and enforced by the people themselves.” So wrote Jane Jacobs in The
    Death and Life of Great American Cities. Jacobs believed that a prerequisite for
    this type of healthy and engaged community was the presence of people who simply
    were present, who looked after the neighborhood. She has been proved right: disadvantaged
    neighborhoods with higher levels of “collective efficacy”—the stuff of loosely
    linked neighbors who trust one another and share expectations about how to make
    their community better—have lower crime rates.3 A single eviction could destabilize
    multiple city blocks, not only the block from which a family was evicted but also
    the block to which it begrudgingly relocated. In this way, displacement contributed
    directly to what Jacobs called “perpetual slums,” churning environments with high
    rates of turnover and even higher rates of resentment and disinvestment. “The
    key link in a perpetual slum is that too many people move out of it too fast—and
    in the meantime dream of getting out.”4 With Doreen’s eviction, Thirty-Second
    Street lost a steadying presence—someone who loved and invested in the neighborhood,
    who contributed to making the block safer—but Wright Street didn’t gain one."

    debate.42 It is a word that speaks to the fact that poverty is not just a product
    of low incomes. It is also a product of extractive markets. Boosting poor people’s
    incomes by increasing the minimum wage or public benefits, say, is absolutely
    crucial. But not all of those extra dollars will stay in the pockets of the poor.
    Wage hikes are tempered if rents rise along with them, just as food stamps are
    worth less if groceries in the inner city cost more—and they do, as much as 40
    percent more, by one estimate.43 Poverty is two-faced—a matter of income and expenses,
    input and output—and in a world of exploitation, it will not be effectively ameliorated
    if we ignore this plain fact.

  content: 'When I first left Oregon I was most excited about two things on my itinerary.
    I wanted to pitch the Japanese my Crazy Idea. And I wanted to stand before the
    Acropolis. Hours before boarding my flight at Heathrow, I meditated on that moment,
    looking up at those astonishing columns, experiencing that bracing shock, the
    kind you receive from all great beauty, but mixed with a powerful sense of—recognition?
    Was it only my imagination? After all, I was standing at the birthplace of Western
    civilization. Maybe I merely wanted it to be familiar. But I didn’t think so.
    I had the clearest thought: I’ve been here before. Then, walking up those bleached
    steps, another thought: This is where it all begins. On my left was the Parthenon,
    which Plato had watched the teams of architects and workmen build. On my right
    was the Temple of Athena Nike. Twenty-five centuries ago, per my guidebook, it
    had housed a beautiful frieze of the goddess Athena, thought to be the bringer
    of “nike,” or victory. It was one of many blessings Athena bestowed. She also
    rewarded the dealmakers. In the Oresteia she says: “I admire . . . the eyes of
    persuasion.” She was, in a sense, the patron saint of negotiators. I don’t know
    how long I stood there, absorbing the energy and power of that epochal place.
    An hour? Three? I don’t know how long after that day I discovered the Aristophanes
    play, set in the Temple of Nike, in which the warrior gives the king a gift—a
    pair of new shoes. I don’t know when I figured out that the play was called Knights.
    I do know that as I turned to leave I noticed the temple’s marble façade. Greek
    artisans had decorated it with several haunting carvings, including the most famous,
    in which the goddess inexplicably leans down . . . to adjust the strap of her
    shoe.'

    I’d been unable to sell encyclopedias, and I’d despised it to boot. I’d been slightly
    better at selling mutual funds, but I’d felt dead inside. So why was selling shoes
    so different? Because, I realized, it wasn’t selling. I believed in running. I
    believed that if people got out and ran a few miles every day, the world would
    be a better place, and I believed these shoes were better to run in. People, sensing
    my belief, wanted some of that belief for themselves. Belief, I decided. Belief
    is irresistible.

    glass was full! And it was a bigger glass! Who’s been pinching my beer? And at

    of the people calling for a larger glass), or who had no glass at all, because
    he was at the back of the crowd and had failed to catch the barman’s eye. William
    was one of the glassless. And this was odd, because he’d been born into a family
    that not only had a very large glass indeed but could afford to have people discreetly
    standing around with bottles to keep it filled up. It was self-imposed glasslessness,
    and it had started at a fairly early age when he’d been sent away to school. William’s
    brother, Rupert, being the elder, had gone to the Assassins’ School in Ankh-Morpork,
    widely regarded as being the best school in the world for the full-glass class.
    William, as the less important son, had been sent to Hugglestones, a boarding
    school so bleak and spartan that only the upper glasses would send their sons
    there.'

    service, your clients are likely to first check-out your self-serve tier, and
    there will always be a distinction between a 2nd and 3rd tier - because the 2nd
    tier sells to single decision makers, whereas the 3rd tier sells to multiple stakeholders

    in the SMB space, and it is these companies that also obtain high valuation. We
    have seen first hand how companies who achieve success early-on with large Enterprise
    deals, find themselves circling the drain a few years later. The success with
    enterprise deals, required these companies to focus on integration instead of
    innovation. On the other hand clients that enter the market from a freemium/prosumer
    model are able to adopt quickly. Although many are prematurely stamped “successfull”
    by industry pundits, experienced VCs will tell you that they only warrant the
    valuation once success is achieved in the SMB space.

    is that a rocket represents the culmination of what is possible when you carefully
    design a system of trial and error to improve incrementally. We know, sales is
    not rocket science. As sales professionals we have heard that way too often in
    fact. But we believe deeply that sales is not an art. It is a science, and it
    is becoming more of a science each day. And just like astronauts are no longer
    balls-to-the-wall test pilots but instead trained engineers, the men and women
    who practice sales today are highly trained, data driven professionals who rely
    on process to gain incremental improvements. So what is it that sets apart your
    rocket science sales organization? Process. Documented process that results in
    controlled experimentation and deliberate learning which leads to success at scale.
    So when we hear about sales organizations that lack the ability to forecast accurately
    how the month will end, or when only 60% of sales professionals hit quota, we
    ask is that a problem of bad performers? Bad sales leadership? A bad service?
    The wrong clients? We say no ... we say you simply lack the process to learn and
    improve on. Or to nicely close out our analogy - you are trying to launch a rocket
    to Mars without having built a process that results in a Mars landing as the inevitable
    culmination of a process.

    The message on the first day of training needs to be that if they succeed as an
    MDR, in a matter of months they will be able to graduate to a different role,
    building skills as they go. And as they rapidly move through the progression above,
    they acquire skills that are valuable across the entire organization, giving you
    a perfect talent development pool with inbuilt high turnover and the ability to
    move stars elsewhere in your organization.

  content: Before the incident, Corporal Dunham had debated the strength of the Kevlar
    helmet with some squadmates and his platoon commander. Dunham theorized that even
    if the Kevlar might not protect the Marine holding it down from the blast of a
    grenade, it would definitely save the other Marines around him. His squadmates
    doubted that somebody could get their helmet off in time to get it on top of the
    grenade and hold it down with their body. Corporal Dunham practiced this maneuver.
    He would unfasten his helmet, throw it down and jump on top of it. There was no
    way he could have known he would later use this same technique to save the lives
    of his fellow Marines in Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines. While attempting
    to detain an insurgent in Al-Karabilah, Iraq, a hand- to-hand struggle ensued.
    The insurgent pulled out a grenade intending to kill himself, Corporal Dunham,
    and two other Marines. Corporal Dunham disengaged from fighting the man, unclipped
    his chin strap, covered the grenade with his helmet and pressed his body atop
    it. He saved the lives of his two comrades, but was mortally wounded in the process.
    It was a sacrifice he made without hesitation, and for this he was posthumously
    awarded the Medal of Honor. Major Gibson told this story with tears in his eyes.
    “Ownership,” he said, “is the touchstone of leadership. There are three rules
    of leadership that I have learned over the years, and Corporal Dunham exemplified
    all three with this one act. First, leadership by example. “Second, self-sacrifice
    for the greater good. Be willing to do anything for your Marines. Give everything
    you have, and then give some more. Tear yourself to the ground. “Lastly, one man
    can make a difference.”

  content: 'But the divide between reformers and the machine went beyond the simple
    question of which social classes and ethnic groups would be in charge to a deeper
    disagreement over the basic philosophy of government. At its best, Tammany was
    an exemplar of what political scientist Charles Lindblom would call the “branch”
    approach to decision-making: an incremental, usually decentralized and bottom-up
    process of “continually building out from the current situation, step-by-step
    and by small degrees.” Nearly every major aspect of New York City—its economy,
    population, ethnic mix, real estate market, transportation, and public health
    system—was in a constant state of flux, and Tammany’s job was to stay out of the
    way when possible, provide services and deal with crises when needed, and remain
    flexible and responsive enough to keep the votes coming, practitioners of what
    Lindblom called “the science of muddling through.” Educated reformers, on the
    other hand, tended to favor what Lindblom called the “root” approach to decision-making:
    comprehensively analyzing a situation, determining the ideal course of action,
    and then charging forward with it, a generally centralized, top-down process of
    “starting from fundamentals anew each time, building on the past only as experience
    is embodied in a theory, and always prepared to start completely from the ground
    up.” There are merits to both approaches, but the two sides were rarely comprehensible
    to one another, root-approach reformers seeing the machine’s branch approach as
    cynical, plodding, and wasteful (not to mention corrupt) and the pragmatic Tammany
    chieftains writing the good-government types off as starry-eyed dilettantes too
    concerned with simplistic theories of what government and society should be to
    deal with the complicated realities of what the city itself actually was.'

    and reporting back to the higher-ups. Reformers couldn’t hope to build such a
    machine without becoming a “machine” themselves, but by the early twentieth century,
    a few new developments gave them the chance to build an information-gathering
    apparatus of a whole different sort, one based not on individually collected stories
    but mass-aggregated numbers.'

    Back Bay. The trouble with the root approach is that it’s extremely vulnerable

    bad ideas are perhaps more common than with the comprehensive planning of the
    root approach—just think of the number of businesses that open on the wrong block,
    only to close up shop shortly thereafter. But there’s a safety mechanism in that
    failure: the shop owner sees the error of his ways and closes before he wastes
    even more time and money. Because the root approach presumes to have considered
    all possible options before proceeding, there is no equivalent rethinking, and
    bad ideas are given a much longer life-span.'

    exactly the kinds of things Chief Kirby was recommending. Such plans would have
    been classic Tammany pluralism—true branch-approach problem-solving. The programs
    would be hastily assembled and muddled through by trial and error. Some would
    succeed, others fail, and most would be rife with backdoor politicking and corruption.
    It wouldn’t have been particularly analytic, scientific, transparent, or progressive,
    but something would have been done, and done quickly. There were too many buildings,
    votes, and dollars being lost.

    ignore certain realities because they are too complex to quantify—is so common
    that it even has a philosophical justification. Simple models, the conventional

    to keep track of all the moving parts in a complex model. This is true enough,

    neighborhoods in the country and opening them in Staten Island. But lost in a
    modeler’s world that was increasingly divorced from reality, the fire project
    had “stepped through the looking glass,” as RAND physicist Sam Cohen once said
    of his colleagues who worked on systems analysis, “where people did the weirdest
    things and [used] the most perverse kind of logic imaginable and yet claimed to
    have the most precise understanding of everything . . . because it all sounded

    irrationalities and shortcomings. But in the quest to rationalize and centralize
    from the top down, to focus on the big picture and the comprehensive plan, the
    realities of a bottom-up jury-rigged city had fallen through the cracks. Just
    as neighborhoods consumed by flame were pushed to the side by the city and the
    department responsible for protecting them, so too were the lessons to be learned
    in those neighborhoods. Like the War Years themselves, the Waldbaum’s collapse
    was a presumed act of arson that turned out to be caused by big ideas, misaligned
    priorities, and the lost lessons of the Bronx.

  content: From his stint as a consultant he learned something valuable, however.
    It seemed to him that a big part of a consultant’s job was to feign total certainty
    about uncertain things. In a job interview with McKinsey, they told him that he
    was not certain enough in his opinions. “And I said it was because I wasn’t certain.
    And they said, ‘We’re billing clients five hundred grand a year, so you have to
    be sure of what you are saying.’” The consulting firm that eventually hired him
    was forever asking him to exhibit confidence when, in his view, confidence was
    a sign of fraudulence. They’d asked him to forecast the price of oil for clients,
    for instance. “And then we would go to our clients and tell them we could predict
    the price of oil. No one can predict the price of oil. It was basically nonsense.”

    Once we made the process the subject of our investigation, we’d be able to break

    step that we could measure and control in the design of a product.

    First we analyze the Job-to-be-Done and capture all the customers’ needs in the

    each outcome and how well the solution they use today satisfies each outcome.
    With this data we determine which outcomes are most under-and overserved. Under-and
    overserved outcomes represent innovation opportunities. Third, we use factor analysis
    and cluster analysis to segment the market into groups of customers with unique
    sets of unmet desired outcomes. Lastly, we use profiling questions we include
    in the survey to understand what factors cause complexity and make some customers
    struggle more than others to get the job done. The survey also collects information

    the company can take the seven courses of action shown in the figure below for
    each segment: (1) Borrow features from other company offerings. (2) Accelerate
    offerings in the pipeline and R&D. (3) Partner with or license from other firms.
    (4) Acquire another firm to fill a gap. (5) Devise a new feature set. (6) Devise
    new subsystems and/or ancillary services. (7) Conceptualize the ultimate solution.
    Let’s look at how each activity is enhanced when it is informed by outcome-based
    market research.'

  content: Outcome-Based Segmentation gave us a more realistic way to look at the
    market. Over time we had confused sales prioritization with real customer market
    segmentation. At the end of the day, we only have a certain number of salespeople,
    so we tend to want to call on the larger dairies, because if you get one of them,
    they have a measurable impact on your business. We just assumed that all those
    large dairies share certain needs, and that small dairies have completely different
    needs. The data showed that was not the case, so that absolutely was surprising.

  content: To identify opportunities for product innovation, the Bosch team targeted
    professional tradesmen (the job executors) who were responsible for cutting wood
    in a straight line (the Job-to-be-Done). They targeted roofers, framers, contractors,
    finish carpenters, plumbers and electricians. Through interviews with the professional
    tradesmen, the ODI practitioner dissected the Job-to-be-Done into its component
    parts through the use of a job map and worked to capture a complete set of approximately
    85 desired outcome statements. Next, ODI-based quantitative research methods were
    employed. Through a controlled online survey, approximately 270 professional tradesmen
    rated each desired outcome statement for (i) its level of importance, and (ii)
    the degree to which it was satisfied, given the circular saws they were currently
    using. This data was used to run a variety of data analyses (Outcome-Based Segmentation,
    competitive analysis, etc.).

    what challenges they still face. These are your ideal, current user, and you need
    to truly understand the value you’re delivering to them in order to develop some
    ideas for how you could do better. But don’t stop there. You also want to talk
    to some of the folks who are using your product but don’t feel it makes their
    lives easier. These are the people who answered “No” to your question, but for

    focused at different points of your product development cycle (see Figure 8.13).
    FIGURE 8.13 The Game Thinking Roadmap from the marvelous Amy Jo Kim. You can see
    from the line that you start at habit building, move to working on onboarding,
    then discovery, and finally mastery. Amy Jo said, “You work backward from that
    core nugget of everyday value.” Once you know what your core loop is, you refine
    your onboarding, and then you figure out how to create messaging for discovery
    that conveys the value to your ideal customer. Finally, you’re going to make sure
    that the product stays compelling for retained users, but not until you’ve been
    around for long enough to have some retained users.

    See, Think, Do, and Care: • See: These are people who have no current intent to

    probably interested in the space your product inhabits. • Think: These are people
    who are thinking about products in your category, but they’re not actively considering
    buying right now. • Do: These are people who are actively in purchase mode or
    have just purchased your product. • Care: These are your current most valuable,
    loyal users. Let’s look at an example. Imagine that you own a gym, and you’re
    wondering whom to reach in order to make more revenue. Here are your intent clusters:
    • See: These are folks who are likely to care about their health and well being.
    • Think: These are the people who have noticed that they’re putting on a little
    weight and are thinking about ways to take it off. • Do: People in this cluster
    are actively looking for a gym and may have even come in to check out your facilities
    or have used a guest pass to try out some classes. • Care: These people already

    whether people are sharing the content you’re putting out. • Think Metrics: Click-through
    rate, page depth, and percent assisted. These are metrics for your marketing website
    or blog or newsletter—however you’re delivering content—that show how deeply people
    are engaging with the information you’re delivering them and whether that outreach
    is eventually leading to a purchase. • Do Metrics: Visitor loyalty, checkout/abandonment
    rate, conversion, and profit. Again, the Do cluster is all about purchasing, so
    the metrics you care about will be those dealing with whether visitors make it
    all the way through the purchase process. • Care Metrics: Repeat purchases, likelihood
    to recommend, and lifetime value. For this cluster, you care about keeping users
    around for the long haul and getting them excited enough to turn them into brand
    advocates so that their value to you increases over time.'

    are heard and their ideas treated with respect. They understand how their practical
    decisions affect the direction of the organization or community. They know how
    to have a positive effect on their own future. They have deeper respect for others
    in the organization. They understand their situation better, because they have
    integrated the perspectives of others with their own. They talk about assuming
    greater responsibility for the whole organization, because they have participated
    in determining what is necessary. They want to expand their personal capacities
    in ways they have not used before. Second, they see a change in other people.
    They notice people listening more carefully, being less fearful of new situations,
    and building up the confidence that comes with accomplishing goals as a team.
    They notice colleagues trying out creative, innovative solutions to previously
    insoluble problems. They recognize that the group as a whole is demonstrating
    values, exhibiting behaviors, and generating results. Everyone is taking more
    interest in their work.  Third, they talk about the positive impact that the organization
    is having on its intended stakeholders or on society. They mention how the organization
    has a new story about its role, and how that story is being acted upon. They refer
    to a new courage in the organization’s ability to act, and how this courage is
    not simply vested in the leadership at the top, but is imbedded throughout the
    organization. It seems that the old riddle of “What comes first … personal transformation?
    Or social transformation?” has been solved. They occur simultaneously, with a
    feedback loop from one to the other.

    books on business strategy, including The Competitive Advantage of Nations and
    Competitive Strategy. He stresses the importance of three different strategies,
    especially segmentation, cost leadership, and differentiation. Countering this
    approach, C. K. Prahalad, and Gary Hamel have noted how quickly competitive positions
    can be overturned, requiring all businesses to focus on their core competencies.
    ToP practitioners have paid heed to all these warnings, and generally avoid the
    traps of developing certain “types” of strategies as does, for instance, the Balanced
    Scorecard. ToP methods place energy and priority on developing “insight” and “breakthrough,”
    in the areas that are determined by the analysis.

    paradigm from many other planning methods—one where everyone is assumed to have
    wisdom to communicate, where everyone is responsible for the outcome, and where
    the empowerment they experience during the process models the empowerment to implement
    the final results. From this perspective, what happens to a group while doing
    the planning is just as important as what the group produces.

    Another early foundation is the nature of unlimited human potential found in the
    existential philosophy foreshadowed by Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche,
    establishing the basis for willing transformation. Paul Tillich’s Systematic Theology
    includes important contributions on personal transformation. Ethics, contextual
    ethics, and indicative ethics are all rich grounds where Kant and Bonhoeffer describe
    the tensions between the internal world of the individual and the world of external
    relationships, and between freedom and obligation. The Courage to Lead, by Brian

  content: The biggest problem with projecting data to analyze trends is that every
    trend has a countervailing force. Sometimes that countervailing force can be just
    as visible as the trend itself, causing confusion in the data. For example, there
    seems to have been an inescapable trend toward global trade over the past 30 years.
    At the same time, there seems to be a countervailing force toward trade protectionism.
    Numbers will prove both.

    the motivations and psychology of these people. You see, we had then sincerely
    assumed that our editors were simply afraid of the higher-ups and didn’t want
    to make themselves vulnerable by publishing yet another dubious work by extremely
    dubious authors. And the entire time, in all our letters and applications, we
    took great pains to emphasize that which to us seemed completely obvious: the
    novel contained nothing criminal; it was quite ideologically appropriate and certainly
    not dangerous in that sense. And the fact that the world depicted in it was coarse,
    cruel, and hopeless, well, that was how it had to be—it was the world of “decaying
    capitalism and triumphant bourgeois ideology.” It didn’t even cross our minds
    that the issue had nothing to do with ideology. They, those quintessential “bloody
    fools,” actually did think this way: that language must be as colorless, smooth,
    and glossy as possible and certainly shouldn’t be at all coarse; that science
    fiction necessarily has to be fantastic and on no account should have anything
    to do with crude, observable, and brutal reality; that the reader must in general
    be protected from reality—let him live by daydreams, reveries, and beautiful incorporeal
    ideas. The heroes of a novel shouldn’t “walk,” they should “advance”; not talk
    but “utter”; on no account “yell” but only “exclaim.” This was a certain peculiar
    aesthetic, a reasonably self-contained notion of literature in general and of
    science fiction in particular—a peculiar worldview, if you like. One that’s rather
    widespread, by the way, and relatively harmless, but only under the condition
    that the holder of this worldview isn’t given the chance to influence the literary
    process.'

    create a clear decision-making process that empowers people closest to the facts
    to make as many decisions as possible. Not only does that result in better decisions,
    it results in better morale. The decider should get facts, not recommendations
    When collecting information for a decision, we are often tempted to ask people
    for their recommendations—“What do you think we should do?”—but as one executive
    I worked with at Apple explained to me, people tend to put their egos into recommendations
    in a way that can lead to politics, and thus worse decisions. So she recommended
    seeking “facts, not recommendations.” Of course “facts” come inflected with each
    person’s particular perspective or point of view, but they are less likely to
    become a line in the sand than a recommendation is.

    but in focusing on the big philosophical question, there’s a mundane reality that
    these stories gloss over. It’s similar to the way movies always depict love in
    terms of grand romantic gestures when, over the long term, love also means working
    through money problems and picking dirty laundry off the floor. So while achieving
    legal rights for AIs would be a major step, another milestone that would be just
    as important is people putting real effort into their individual relationships
    with AIs. And even if we don’t care about them having legal rights, there’s still
    good reason to treat conscious machines with respect. You don’t have to believe
    that bomb-sniffing dogs deserve the right to vote to recognize that abusing them
    is a bad idea. Even if all you care about is how well they can detect bombs, it’s
    in your best interest that they be treated well. No matter whether we want AIs
    to fill the role of employees, lovers, or pets, I suspect they will do a better
    job if, during their development, there were people who cared about them.

  content: Because so many accessibility errors relating to assistive technologies
    are markup errors, and because markup errors are so easy to identify, we’ve grown
    up in an accessibility remediation culture that is assistive technology obsessed
    and focused on discrete code errors. Inclusive design has a different take. It
    acknowledges the importance of markup in making semantic, robust interfaces, but
    it is the user’s ability to actually get things done that it makes the object.
    The quality of the markup is measured by what it can offer in terms of UX.

    a new technology’s potential economies of scale or scope. Part two: an investment
    in a national and international marketing and distribution network so that sales
    could keep pace with production. Part three: an investment in management. That’s
    where HBS came in. Companies suddenly needed managers not just to run the production
    and distribution mechanisms, but also to monitor and coordinate the two, planning
    and allocating resources for future production. The larger the firm, the more
    operating units, and the more managerial oversight required.'

    is mere flattery used to persuade for personal gain. Or maybe they weren’t. In

    found the exact thing they’d been looking for: a real-life executive who validated
    their ideas about enlightened management. But in the wrong hands—which included,
    it would seem, his own—all Barnard’s particular approach to human relations did
    was replace autocracy with paternalism. And in doing so, he helped lay the foundations
    of an insidious cult of moral leadership that we are still grappling with today.
    By making the case that success is a result of moral purity—and that corporate
    leadership is intrinsically moral—he left us not just with the dangers of false

    moral leadership. “Only those who recognize that they may be or become morally

    When Annabelle gets the feedback that she’s difficult, she insists that she’s
    not difficult, saying in essence, “I have positive intentions and therefore positive
    impacts.” But she doesn’t actually realize what impacts she’s having. Instead,
    she should talk about intentions and impacts separately: “I’ve been working hard
    to be more patient [arrow 2, my intentions]. And yet it sounds like that’s not
    the impact I’m having [arrow 4]. That’s upsetting. Let’s figure out why.” Feedback

    encounter online—the form fields and menus we tend to gloss over so quickly. Because
    if we want tech companies to be more accountable, we need to be able to identify
    and articulate what’s going wrong, and put pressure on them to change (or on government
    to regulate their actions). It’s never been more important that we demand this
    kind of accountability. Failing to design systems that reflect and represent diverse
    groups can alienate customers and make people feel marginalized on an individual
    level, and that would be reason enough for us to demand better. But there’s also
    a pressing societal concern here. When systems don’t allow users to express their
    identities, companies end up with data that doesn’t reflect the reality of their
    users. And as we’ll see in the coming chapters, when companies (and, increasingly,
    their artificial-intelligence systems) rely on that information to make choices
    about how their products work, they can wreak havoc—affecting everything from
    personal safety to political contests to prison sentences.

  content: 'Uber may be an extreme example, but it can help us understand tech’s insular
    culture much more clearly: if tech wants to be seen as special—and therefore able
    to operate outside the rules—then it helps to position the people working inside
    tech companies as special too. And the best way to ensure that happens is to build
    a monoculture, where insiders bond over a shared belief in their own brilliance.
    That’s also why you see so many ridiculous job titles floating around Silicon
    Valley and places like it: “rock-star” designers, “ninja” JavaScript developers,
    user-experience “unicorns” (yes, these are all real). Fantastical labels like
    these reinforce the idea that tech and design are magical: skill sets that those
    on the outside wouldn’t understand, and could never learn. The reality is a lot
    more mundane: design and programming are just professions—sets of skills and practices,
    just like any other field. Admitting that truth would make tech positions feel
    a lot more welcoming to diverse employees, but tech can’t tell that story to the
    masses. If it did, then the industry would seem normal, understandable, and accessible—and
    that would make everyday people more comfortable pushing back when its ideas are
    intrusive or unethical. So, tech has to maintain its insider-y, more-brilliant-than-thou
    feel—which affects who decides to enter that legendary “pipeline,” and whether
    they’ll stick around once they’ve arrived. Plus, there’s the pesky problem of
    how diverse teams challenge existing cultures. In all that research about the
    benefits of diversity, one finding sticks out: it can feel harder to work on a
    diverse team. “Dealing with outsiders causes friction, which feels counterproductive,”
    write researchers David Rock, Heidi Grant, and Jacqui Grey.35 But experiments
    have shown that this type of friction is actually helpful, because it leads teams
    to push past easy answers and think through solutions more carefully. “In fact,
    working on diverse teams produces better outcomes precisely because it’s harder,”
    they conclude. That’s a tough sell for tech companies, though. As soon as you
    invite in “outsiders” who question the status quo—people like Uber’s “Amy,” who
    ask whether the choices being made are ethical—it’s hard to skate by without scrutiny
    anymore. As a result, maintaining the monoculture becomes more important than
    improving products.'

    “you have entrusted me with the job of president during a difficult time. The
    crisis we face now, of abrupt climate change and crippling damage to the biosphere,
    is a very dangerous one, to be sure. But we are not at war with anyone, and in
    fact we face a challenge that all humanity has to meet together. On this podium,
    Franklin Roosevelt said, ‘This generation has a rendezvous with destiny.’ Now
    it’s true again. We are the generation that has to deal with the profound destruction
    that will be caused by the global warming that has already been set in motion.
    The potential disruption of the natural order is so great that scientists warn
    of a mass extinction event. Losses on that scale would endanger all humanity,
    and so we cannot fail to address the threat. The lives of our children, and all
    their descendants, depend on us doing so. “So, like FDR and his generation, we
    have to face the great challenge of our time. We have to use our government to
    organize a total social response to the problem. That took courage then, and we
    will need courage now. In the years since we used our government to help get us
    out of the Great Depression, it has sometimes been fashionable to belittle the
    American government as some kind of foreign burden laid on us. That attitude is
    nothing more than an attack on American history, deliberately designed to shift
    power away from the American people. I want us to remember how Abraham Lincoln
    said it: ‘that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall
    not perish from this Earth.’ This is the crucial concept of American democracy—that
    government expresses what the majority of us would like to do as a society. It’s
    us. We do it to us and for us. I believe this reminder is so important that I
    intend to add the defining phrase ‘of the people, by the people, and for the people’
    every time I use the word ‘government,’ and I intend to do all I can to make that
    phrase be a true description. It will make me even more long-winded than I was
    before, but I am willing to pay that price, and you are going to have to pay it
    with me. “So, this winter, with your approval and support, I intend to instruct
    my team in the executive branch of government of the people, by the people, and
    for the people, to initiate a series of federal actions and changes designed to
    meet the problem of global climate change head-on. We will deal with it as a society
    working together, and working with the rest of the world. It’s a global project,
    and so I will go to the United Nations and tell them that the United States is
    ready to join the international effort. We will also help the under-developed
    world to develop using clean technology, so that all the good aspects of development
    will not be drowned in its bad side effects—often literally drowned. In our own
    country, meanwhile, we will do all it takes to shift to clean technologies as
    quickly as possible.” Phil paused to survey the crowd. “My, it’s cold out here
    today! You can feel right now, right down to the bone, that what I am saying is
    true. We’re out in the cold, and we need to change the way we do things. And it’s
    not just a technological problem, having to do with our machinery alone. The devastation
    of the biosphere is also a result of there being too many human beings for the
    planet to support over the long haul. If the human population continues to increase
    as it has risen in the past, all progress we might make will be overwhelmed. “But
    what is very striking to observe is that everywhere on this Earth where good standards
    of justice prevail, the rate of reproduction is about at the replacement rate.
    While wherever justice, and the full array of rights as described in the UN Declaration
    of Human Rights, is somehow denied to some portion of the population, especially
    to women and children, the rate of reproduction either balloons to unsustainably
    rapid growth rates, or crashes outright. Now you can argue all you want about
    why this correlation exists, but the correlation itself is striking and undeniable.
    So this is one of those situations in which what we do for good in one area, helps
    us again in another. It is a positive feedback loop with the most profound implications.
    Consider: for the sake of climate stabilization, there must be population stabilization;
    and for there to be population stabilization, justice must prevail. Every person
    on the planet must live with the full array of human rights that all nations have
    already ascribed to when signing the UN Charter. When we achieve that, at that
    point, and at that point only, we will begin to reproduce at a sustainable rate.
    “To help that to happen, I intend to make sure that the United States joins the
    global justice project fully, unequivocally, and without any double standards.
    This means accepting the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, and
    the jurisdiction of the World Court in the Hague. It means abiding by all the
    clauses of the UN Charter and the Geneva Conventions, which after all we have
    already signed. It means supporting UN peacekeeping forces, and supporting the
    general concept of the UN as the body through which international conflicts get
    resolved. It means supporting the World Health Organization in all its reproductive
    rights and population reduction efforts. It means supporting women’s education
    and women’s rights everywhere, even in cultures where men’s tyrannies are claimed
    to be some sort of tradition. All these commitments on our part will be crucial
    if we are serious about building a sustainable world. There are three legs to
    this effort, folks: technology, environment, and social justice. None of the three
    can be neglected. “So, some of what we do may look a little unconventional at
    first. And it may look more than a little threatening to those few who have been
    trying, in effect, to buy our government of the people, by the people, and for
    the people, and use it to line their own pockets while the world goes smash. But
    you know what? Those people need to change too. They’re out in the cold the same
    as the rest of us. So we will proceed, and hope those opposed come to see the
    good in it. “Ultimately we will be exploring all peaceful means to initiate positive
    changes in our systems, in order to hand on to the generations to come a world
    that is as beautiful and bountiful as the one we were born into. We are only the
    temporary stewards of a mighty trust, which includes the lives of all the future
    generations to come. We are responsible to our children and theirs. What we do
    now will reveal much about our character and our values as a people. We have to
    rise to the occasion, and I think we can and will. I am going to throw myself
    into the effort wholeheartedly and with a feeling of high excitement, as if beginning
    a long journey over stormy seas.”"

    people. Your happiness lies there. Try it and see. Make the experiment and analyze

  content: No matter what the product or service is, you get consumers who have a
    ‘notional demand,’ which is what they would buy if they could, and then ‘completely
    adjusted demand,’ which is what they really intend to buy knowing all the constraints,
    using what he calls ‘expectation theory.’ Between those you have ‘partially adjusted
    demand,’ where the consumer is in ignorance of what’s possible, or in denial about
    the situation, and still not completely adjusted. So the move from notional demand
    to completely adjusted demand is marked by failure, frustration, dire rumors,
    forced choices, and so on down his list. Finally the adjustment is complete, and
    the buyer has abandoned certain intentions, and might even forget them if asked.

    section as “scriptlessness.” Psychological studies, for instance, find that men
    or women who had experienced unrequited love during adolescence were in most cases
    eventually able to come to terms with the experience and showed few permanent
    emotional scars. But for those who had been the objects of unrequited love, it
    was quite another matter. Many still struggled with guilt and confusion. One major
    reason, researchers concluded, was precisely the lack of cultural models. Anyone
    who falls in love with someone who does not return their affections has thousands
    of years’ worth of romantic literature to tell them exactly how they are supposed
    to feel; however, while this literature provides detailed insight on the experience
    of being Cyrano, it generally tells you very little about how you are supposed
    to feel—let alone what you’re supposed to do—if you’re Roxane.7 Many, probably
    most, bullshit jobs involve a similar agonizing scriptlessness. Not only are the
    codes of behavior ambiguous, no one is even sure what they are supposed to say
    or how they are supposed to feel about their situation.

  content: 'recognized as value-creating labor in itself. “Caring labor” is generally
    seen as work directed at other people, and it always involves a certain labor
    of interpretation, empathy, and understanding. To some degree, one might argue
    that this is not really work at all, it’s just life, or life lived properly—humans
    are naturally empathetic creatures, and to communicate with one another at all,
    we must constantly cast ourselves imaginatively into each other’s shoes and try
    to understand what others are thinking and feeling, which usually means caring
    about them at least a little—but it very much becomes work when all the empathy
    and imaginative identification is on one side. The key to caring labor as a commodity
    is not that some people care but that others don’t; that those paying for “services”
    (note how the old feudal term is still retained) feel no need to engage in interpretive
    labor themselves. This is even true of a bricklayer, if that bricklayer is working
    for someone else. Underlings have to constantly monitor what the boss is thinking;
    the boss doesn’t have to care. That, in turn, is one reason, I believe, why psychological
    studies regularly find that people of working-class background are more accurate
    at reading other people’s feelings, and more empathetic and caring, than those
    of middle-class, let alone wealthy, backgrounds.47 To some degree, the skill at
    reading others’ emotions is just an effect of what working-class work actually
    consists of: rich people don’t have to learn how to do interpretive labor nearly
    as well because they can hire other people to do it for them. Those hirelings,
    on the other hand, who have to develop a habit of understanding other’s points
    of view, will also tend to care about them.48 By this token, as many feminist
    economists have pointed out, all labor can be seen as caring labor, since—to turn
    to an example from the beginning of the chapter—even if one builds a bridge, it’s
    ultimately because one cares about people who might wish to cross the river. As
    the examples I cited at the time make clear, people do really think in these terms
    when they reflect on the “social value” of their jobs.49 To think of labor as
    valuable primarily because it is “productive,” and productive labor as typified
    by the factory worker, effecting that magic transformation by which cars or teabags
    or pharmaceutical products are “produced” out of factories through the same painful
    but ultimately mysterious “labor” by which women are seen to produce babies, allows
    one to make all this disappear. It also makes it maximally easy for the factory
    owner to insist that no, actually, workers are really no different from the machines
    they operate. Clearly, the growth of what came to be called “scientific management”
    made this easier; but it would never have been possible had the paradigmatic example
    of “worker” in the popular imagination been a cook, a gardener, or a masseuse.'

    of the very idea of policy. Policy implies the existence of an elite group—government
    officials, typically—that gets to decide on something (“a policy”) that they then
    arrange to be imposed on everybody else. There’s a little mental trick we often
    play on ourselves when discussing such matters. We say, for instance, “What are
    we going to do about the problem of X?” as if “we” were society as a whole, somehow
    acting on ourselves, but, in fact, unless we happen to be part of that roughly
    3 percent to 5 percent of the population whose views actually do affect policy
    makers, this is all a game of make-believe; we are identifying with our rulers
    when, in fact, we’re the ones being ruled. This is what happens when we watch
    a politician on television say “What shall we do about the less fortunate?” even
    though at least half of us would almost certainly fit that category ourselves.
    Myself, I find such games particularly pernicious because I’d prefer not to have
    policy elites around at all. I’m personally an anarchist, which means that, not
    only do I look forward to a day sometime in the future when governments, corporations,
    and the rest will be looked at as historical curiosities in the same way as we
    now look at the Spanish Inquisition or nomadic invasions, but I prefer solutions
    to immediate problems that do not give more power to governments or corporations,
    but rather, give people the means to manage their own affairs.

    people fall into the same dynamic, there’s never such an easy way out. “You can’t

    and could even become the basis for a theory of social liberation. I like to think
    that Michel Foucault, the French social philosopher, was moving in this direction
    before his tragic death in 1984. Foucault, according to people who knew him, underwent
    a remarkable personal transformation on discovering BDSM, turning from a notoriously
    cagey and standoffish personality to one suddenly warm, open, and friendly23—but
    his theoretical ideas also entered into a period of transformation that he was
    never able to fully bring to fruit. Foucault, of course, is famous mainly as a
    theorist of power, which he saw as flowing through all human relationships, even
    as the basic substance of human sociality, since he once defined it as simply
    a matter of “acting on another’s actions.”24 This always created a peculiar paradox
    because while he wrote in such a way as to suggest he was an antiauthoritarian
    opposed to power, he defined power in such a way that social life would impossible
    without it. At the very end of his career, he seems to have aimed to resolve the
    dilemma by introducing a distinction between what he called power and domination.
    The first, he said, was just a matter of “strategic games.” Everyone is playing
    power games all the time, we can hardly help it, but neither is there anything

  content: If you are a midlevel manager, your boss sets your goals. Or, if you work
    in an enlightened company, you and your boss negotiate over your goals. In either
    setting, it is natural to think of strategies as actions designed to accomplish
    specific goals. However, taking this way of thinking into a top-level position
    is a mistake. Being a general manager, CEO, president, or other top-level leader
    means having more power and being less constrained. Effective senior leaders don’t
    chase arbitrary goals. Rather, they decide which general goals should be pursued.
    And they design the subgoals that various pieces of the organization work toward.
    Indeed, the cutting edge of any strategy is the set of strategic objectives (subgoals)
    it lays out. One of the challenges of being a leader is mastering this shift from
    having others define your goals to being the architect of the organization’s purposes
    and objectives. To help clarify this distinction it is helpful to use the word
    “goal” to express overall values and desires and to use the word “objective” to
    denote specific operational targets. Thus, the United States may have “goals”
    of freedom, justice, peace, security, and happiness. It is strategy which transforms
    these vague overall goals into a coherent set of actionable objectives—defeat
    the Taliban and rebuild a decaying infrastructure. A leader’s most important job
    is creating and constantly adjusting this strategic bridge between goals and objectives.

  content: One of the main projects at JPL was Surveyor, an unmanned machine that
    would soft-land on the moon, take measurements and photographs, and, in later
    missions, deploy a small roving vehicle. The most vexing problem for the Surveyor
    design team had been that no one knew what the moon’s surface was like.2 Scientists
    had worked up three or four theories about how the moon was formed. The lunar
    surface might be soft, the powdery residue of eons of meteoric bombardment. It
    might be a nest of needle-sharp crystals. It might be a jumble of large boulders,
    like a glacial moraine. Would a vehicle sink into powder? Would it be speared
    on needlelike crystals? Would it wedge between giant boulders? Given this ambiguity
    about the lunar surface, engineers had a difficult time creating designs for Surveyor.
    It wasn’t that you couldn’t design a vehicle; it was that you couldn’t defend
    any one design against someone else’s story about the possible horrors of the
    lunar surface. At that time, I worked for Phyllis Buwalda, who directed Future
    Mission Studies at JPL. Homeschooled on a ranch in Colorado, Phyllis had a tough,
    practical intellect that could see to the root of a problem. She was best known
    for her work on a model of the lunar surface.3 With this specification in place,
    JPL engineers and subcontractors were able to stop guessing and get to work. The
    lunar surface Phyllis described was hard and grainy, with slopes of no more than
    about fifteen degrees, scattered small stones, and boulders no larger than about
    two feet across spaced here and there. Looking at this specification for the first
    time, I was amazed. “Phyllis,” I said, “this looks a lot like the Southwestern
    desert.” “Yes, doesn’t it?” she said with a smile. “But,” I complained, “you really
    don’t know what the moon is like. Why write a spec saying it is like the local
    desert?” “This is what the smoother parts of the earth are like, so it is probably
    a pretty good guess as to what we’ll find on the moon if we stay away from the
    mountains.” “But, you really have no idea what the surface of the moon is like!
    It could be powder, or jagged needles.…” “Look,” she said, “the engineers can’t
    work without a specification. If it turns out to be a lot more difficult than
    this, we aren’t going to be spending much time on the moon anyway.”

    applies to most organized human effort. Like the Surveyor design teams, every
    organization faces a situation where the full complexity and ambiguity of the
    situation is daunting. An important duty of any leader is to absorb a large part
    of that complexity and ambiguity, passing on to the organization a simpler problem—one
    that is solvable. Many leaders fail badly at this responsibility, announcing ambitious
    goals without resolving a good chunk of ambiguity about the specific obstacles
    to be overcome. To take responsibility is more than a willingness to accept the
    blame. It is setting proximate objectives and handing the organization a problem
    it can actually solve.

    that you will be surrounded by predictable biases in forecasting. For instance,
    people rarely predict that a business or economic trend will peak and then decline.
    If sales of a product are growing rapidly, the forecast will be for continued
    growth, with the rate of growth gradually declining to “normal” levels. Such a
    prediction may be valid for a frequently purchased product, but it can be far
    off for a durable good. For durable products—such as flat-screen televisions,
    fax machines, and power mowers—there is an initial rapid expansion of sales when
    the product is first offered, but after a period of time everyone who is interested
    has acquired one, and sales can suffer a sharp drop. After that, sales track population
    growth and replacement demand. Predicting the existence of such peaks is not difficult,
    although the timing cannot be pinned down until the growth rate begins to slow.

    one’s own insights. In my own case, I rely on outside help—I invoke a virtual
    panel of experts that I carry around in my mind. This panel of experts is a collection
    of people whose judgments I value. I use an internal mental dialogue with them
    to both critique my own ideas and stimulate new ones. I try to do this before
    putting my ideas before others. The panel of experts trick works because we are
    adept at recognizing and comprehending well-integrated human personalities. Thinking
    through how a particular well-remembered expert might respond to a problem can
    be a richer source of criticism and advice than abstract theories or frameworks.
    My own personal virtual panel of experts contains respected executives I have
    known and worked with, people who educated and trained me, colleagues I have worked
    with over the years, and certain people whose points of view emerge clearly from
    their own written work or from biography. When I face a problem, or have generated
    a first hunch, I turn to this panel and ask, “What is wrong with this approach
    to the situation? What would you do in this case?” Professor Bruce Scott, who
    chaired my dissertation committee long ago in 1971, sits on my panel of experts.
    In my imagination, I can see him, leaning back in his chair and asking me to explain
    why anyone should listen to me and to tell him what the action implication is

    that nobody here has practical advice for how to move on. Maybe I was expecting
    too much of the philosophers. What I learn, however, is that Karl Popper’s idea
    that scientific theories must be falsifiable has long been an outdated philosophy.
    I am glad to hear this, as it’s a philosophy that nobody in science ever could
    have used, other than as a rhetorical device. It is rarely possible to actually
    falsify an idea, since ideas can always be modified or extended to match incoming
    evidence. Rather than falsifying theories, therefore, we “implausify” them: a
    continuously adapted theory becomes increasingly difficult and arcane—not to say
    ugly—and eventually practitioners lose interest. How much it takes to implausify
    an idea, however, depends on one’s tolerance for repeatedly making a theory fit
    conflicting evidence.'

    had allowed her to be wildly popular with MarketWorld elites and more easily digested

    into her life as never before and heightened her awareness of it; and its ferocity
    convinced her not to take on that system but to conclude that it might never change;
    and this acquiescence made her turn from uprooting sexism to helping women survive
    it. She had been drafted into a growing brigade: the theorists of the kind of
    change that leaves the underlying issues untouched. “I might have a view that’s
    a little bit unorthodox,” said Cuddy, “which is that, actually, we have done a
    really good job of documenting the problems and the mechanisms underlying them,”

    about giving back. Inequality is about how you make the money that you’re giving
    back in the first place.” Inequality, he said, is about the nature of the system.
    To fight inequality means to change the system. For a privileged person, it means
    to look into one’s own privilege. And, he said, “you cannot change it by yourself.
    You can change the system only together. With charity, essentially, if you have
    money, you can do a lot of things alone.” This distinction ran parallel to Cuddy’s
    reframing of her antisexism message in her TED talk. What motivated her to study
    the topic was inequality—specifically, a lack of power in one set of students
    because of the power held by another set (and people like them). This was a crime
    with a victim and a perpetrator. By the time this idea made it to TED, the inequality,
    as we’ve seen, had been resculpted into poverty. “Women,” Cuddy said, “feel chronically
    less powerful than men.” The crime was still a crime, but now it wanted for suspects."

    as a mode of human problem-solving was in a long free fall. But for many who heard

    inequities of the age to drop their complaining. “It has become an ideology of:
    The world today may be complex and complicated and confusing in many ways, but
    the reality is that if you take the long-term perspective you will realize how
    good we have it,” Giussani said. The ideology, he said, told people, “You’re being
    unrealistic, and you’re not looking at things in the right way. And if you think
    that you have problems, then, you know, your problems don’t really matter compared
    to the past’s, and your problems are really not problems, because things are getting
    better.” Giussani had heard rich men do this kind of thing so often that he had
    invented a verb for the act: They were “Pinkering”—using the long-run direction
    of human history to minimize, to delegitimize the concerns of those without power.
    There was also economic Pinkering, which “is to tell people the global economy
    has been great because five hundred million Chinese have gone from poverty to
    the middle class. And, of course, that’s true,” Giussani said. “But if you tell
    that to the guy who has been fired from a factory in Manchester because his job
    was taken to China, he may have a different reaction. But we don’t care about

  content: In a 5–4 decision in Lochner v. New York, the U.S. Supreme Court voided
    a state law establishing that bakers could work no longer than ten hours a day,
    six days a week, on the ground that the law violated a business owner’s liberty
    of contract, the freedom to forge agreements with his workers, something the court’s
    majority said was protected under the Fourteenth Amendment. The laissez-faire
    conservatism of the court was informed, in part, by social Darwinism, which suggested
    that the parties in disputes should be left to battle it out, and if one side
    had an advantage, even so great an advantage as a business owner has over its
    employees, then it should win. In a dissenting opinion in Lochner, Oliver Wendell
    Holmes accused the court of violating the will of the people. “This case is decided
    upon an economic theory which a large part of the country does not entertain,”
    he began. The court, he said, had also wildly overreached its authority and had
    carried social Darwinism into the Constitution. “A Constitution is not intended
    to embody a particular economic theory,” Holmes wrote. “The Fourteenth Amendment
    does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer’s Social Statics.”33

  content: 'In directing the Office of Facts and Figures, MacLeish hoped not to produce
    propaganda but instead to educate the public about the danger of it. One of his
    office’s earliest pamphlets, Divide and Conquer, relied heavily on Taylor’s book
    to explain to Americans how the Nazi strategy of terror had worked in France.
    To illustrate, it quoted Mein Kampf. “At the bottom of their hearts the great
    masses of the people are more likely to be poisoned than to be consciously and
    deliberately bad,” Hitler had written. “In the primitive simplicity of their minds
    they are more easily victimized by a large than by a small lie, since they sometimes
    tell petty lies themselves but would be ashamed to tell big ones.” MacLeish’s
    pamphlet aimed to defeat Nazi propaganda: “The United States is now subject to
    a total barrage of the Nazi strategy of terror. Hitler thinks Americans are suckers.
    By the very vastness of his program of lies, he hopes to frighten us into believing
    that the Nazis are invincible.”54 Dorothy Thompson, who once described Mein Kampf
    as “eight hundred pages of Gothic script, pathetic gestures, inaccurate German,
    and unlimited self-satisfaction,” had long been making the same argument. “The
    thing which we are all up against is propaganda,” she said. “Sometimes I think
    that this age is going to be called the age of propaganda, an unprecedented rise
    of propaganda, propaganda as a weapon, propaganda as a technique, propaganda as

    been eradicated; it had only been forgotten. “Few things are more evident in modern
    social history than the decline of interest in inequality as an economic issue,”
    Galbraith wrote. “Inequality has ceased to preoccupy men’s minds.” Some of the
    poor were far away from the cities and the suburbs: one-fourth of those who lived
    below the “poverty line” worked on farms. In the Kennedy administration, the War
    on Poverty had its origins in January 1963, after Kennedy read a long essay by
    Dwight Macdonald in The New Yorker, “Our Invisible Poor.” No piece of prose did
    more to make plain the atrocity of poverty in an age of affluence. Prosperity,
    Macdonald argued, had left the nation both blinded to the plight of the poor and
    indifferent to their suffering. “There is a monotony about the injustices suffered
    by the poor that perhaps accounts for the lack of interest the rest of society
    shows in them,” Macdonald wrote, in a scathing indictment of the attitude of the
    American middle class toward those less well off. “Everything seems to go wrong
    with them. They never win. It’s just boring.”50'

    been introduced into Congress before Kennedy’s assassination, the largest tax
    cut in American history. He hoped it would relieve unemployment. Instead, it undermined
    his reform programs. It was as if he’d cut off one of his own feet. “I want to
    turn the poor from tax eaters to taxpayers,” Johnson said, selling his tax cut
    to Congress. In this formulation, recipients of social programs like Aid to Families
    with Dependent Children (AFDC), created in 1935, and Medicaid, created in 1965,
    were the tax eaters. Recipients of other kinds of federal assistance (Medicare,
    veterans’ benefits, farm subsidies) were the taxpayers. By making this distinction,
    1960s liberals crippled liberalism. The architects of the War on Poverty, like
    the New Dealers before them, never defended a broad-based progressive income tax
    as a public good, in everyone’s interest; nor could they separate it from issues
    of race. They also never referred to Social Security, health care, and unemployment
    insurance as “welfare.” Johnson’s Council of Economic Advisers told him that when
    explaining how the government might fight poverty, he ought to “avoid completely
    the use of the term ‘inequality’ or the term ‘redistribution.’” The poor were
    to be referred to as “targets of opportunity.”70 At first, the tax cut worked:
    people used the money they once used to pay taxes to buy goods. In 1965, Time
    put Keynes on the cover and announced, “We Are All Keynesians Now.”71 But, as
    with everything Johnson did, his economic reforms were demolished by his escalation
    of the war in Vietnam.'

    if he was a good hand surgeon. He replied, “No, but I’m a lucky one,” so I called
    Gordon “Lucky” after that. That may sound droll, but you have to have a certain
    amount of luck piloting ships, just as you do in golf, or life for that matter,
    because not everything works out the way you planned it. Like Gordon, I’d rather
    be a lucky pilot than a good one. Andy Ugarte, a dear Peruvian friend of mine,
    was very successful. He thought success was achieved by being smart, but you also
    needed luck. You needed to be in the right place at the right time, which is what
    happened with Captain Sever. I was surprised how many pilots agreed on one thing;
    we all used body English to help move ships out of harm’s way. This is the equivalent
    of golfers talking to their balls. I caught myself moving my hips a few times,
    hoping to shove a huge ship sideways to avoid trouble. I mumbled a few prayers
    when ships got too damn close to something. Considering how shallow San Francisco
    Bay is, it must have helped, because I was only aground three times, and twice
    it wasn’t my fault.

    of influence practitioners that I encountered something curious: participants
    in the sessions were nearly always informed that persuasion had to be approached
    differently in their particular profession than in related professions. When it
    comes to swaying people, advertising works differently than marketing; marketing
    works differently than fund-raising; fund-raising works differently than public
    relations; public relations works differently than lobbying; lobbying works differently
    than recruitment. And so on. What’s more, distinctions were stressed even within
    professions. Selling whole life insurance is different from selling term insurance;
    selling trucks is different from selling cars; selling by mail or online is different
    from selling in stores; selling products is different from selling services; selling
    to an individual is different from selling to a business; selling wholesale is
    different from selling retail. It’s not that the trainers were wrong in distinguishing
    their own bailiwick from those of their professional neighbors. But this steady
    referencing of their uniqueness led to a pair of lapses in judgment. First, they
    often detoured into distinctions of little consequence. Worse, in their emphasis
    on what’s different among the successful persuasion professions, they didn’t focus
    enough on an extraordinarily useful other question: What’s the same?'

    is to avoid or abbreviate such an arduous process by selecting the first practicable
    candidate that presents itself. This tendency has a quirky name, “satisficing”—a
    term coined by economist and Nobel laureate Herbert Simon—to serve as a blend
    of the words satisfy and suffice. The combination reflects two simultaneous goals
    of a chooser when facing a decision—to make it good and to make it gone—which,
    according to Simon, usually means making it good enough. Although in an ideal
    world one would work and wait until the optimal solution emerged, in the real
    world of mental overload, limited resources, and deadlines, satisficing is the

    I knew it wasn’t likely to be the same for me. I’d learned through the campaign
    stumbles that I had to be better, faster, smarter, and stronger than ever. My
    grace would need to be earned. I worried that many Americans wouldn’t see themselves
    reflected in me, or that they wouldn’t relate to my journey. I wouldn’t have the
    luxury of settling into my new role slowly before being judged. And when it came
    to judgment, I was as vulnerable as ever to the unfounded fears and racial stereotypes
    that lay just beneath the surface of the public consciousness, ready to be stirred
    up by rumor and innuendo. I was humbled and excited to be First Lady, but not
    for one second did I think I’d be sliding into some glamorous, easy role. Nobody
    who has the words “first” and “black” attached to them ever would. I stood at
    the foot of the mountain, knowing I’d need to climb my way into favor. For me,
    it revived an old internal call-and-response, one that tracked all the way back
    to high school, when I’d shown up at Whitney Young and found myself suddenly gripped
    by doubt. Confidence, I’d learned then, sometimes needs to be called from within.
    I’ve repeated the same words to myself many times now, through many climbs. Am
    I good enough? Yes I am. The seventy-six days between election and inauguration
    felt like a critical time to start setting the tone for the kind of First Lady
    I wanted to be.

  content: America is not a simple place. Its contradictions set me spinning. I’d
    found myself at Democratic fund-raisers held in vast Manhattan penthouses, sipping
    wine with wealthy women who would claim to be passionate about education and children’s
    issues and then lean in conspiratorially to tell me that their Wall Street husbands
    would never vote for anyone who even thought about raising their taxes. And now
    I was at Harper, listening to children talking about how to stay alive. I admired
    their resilience, and I wished desperately that they didn’t need it so much. One
    of them then gave me a candid look. “It’s nice that you’re here and all,” he said
    with a shrug. “But what’re you actually going to do about any of this?” To them,
    I represented Washington, D.C., as much as I did the South Side. And when it came
    to Washington, I felt I owed them the truth. “Honestly,” I began, “I know you’re
    dealing with a lot here, but no one’s going to save you anytime soon. Most people
    in Washington aren’t even trying. A lot of them don’t even know you exist.” I
    explained to those students that progress is slow, that they couldn’t afford to
    simply sit and wait for change to come. Many Americans didn’t want their taxes
    raised, and Congress couldn’t even pass a budget let alone rise above petty partisan
    bickering, so there weren’t going to be billion-dollar investments in education
    or magical turnarounds for their community. Even after the horror of Newtown,
    Congress appeared determined to block any measure that could help keep guns out
    of the wrong hands, with legislators more interested in collecting campaign donations
    from the National Rifle Association than they were in protecting kids. Politics
    was a mess, I said. On this front, I had nothing terribly uplifting or encouraging
    to say. I went on, though, to make a different pitch, one that came directly from
    my South Side self. Use school, I said. These kids had just spent an hour telling
    me stories that were tragic and unsettling, but I reminded them that those same
    stories also showed their persistence, self-reliance, and ability to overcome.
    I assured them that they already had what it would take to succeed. Here they
    were, sitting in a school that was offering them a free education, I said, and
    there were a whole lot of committed and caring adults inside that school who thought
    they mattered. About six weeks later, thanks to donations from local businesspeople,
    a group of Harper students would come to the White House, to visit with me and
    Barack personally, and also spend time at Howard University, learning what college
    was about. I hoped that they could see themselves getting there.

  content: Readers may be asking themselves, “But if the neighborhood is really dangerous,
    why is acknowledging this danger a sign of racism?” Research in implicit bias
    has shown that perceptions of criminal activity are influenced by race. White
    people will perceive danger simply by the presence of black people; we cannot
    trust our perceptions when it comes to race and crime.7 But regardless of whether
    the neighborhood is actually more or less dangerous than other neighborhoods,
    what is salient about this exchange is how it functions racially and what that
    means for the white people engaged in it. For my friend and me, this conversation
    did not increase our awareness of the danger of some specific neighborhood. Rather,
    the exchange reinforced our fundamental beliefs about black people. Toni Morrison
    uses the term race talk to capture “the explicit insertion into everyday life
    of racial signs and symbols that have no meaning other than positioning African
    Americans into the lowest level of the racial hierarchy.”8 Casual race talk is
    a key component of white racial framing because it accomplishes the interconnected
    goals of elevating whites while demeaning people of color; race talk always implies
    a racial “us” and “them.”

    nothing is out of sight or out of mind. Nothing is left to lesser people, because
    there’s no such thing. So you, coming in here at – how old are you?’ ‘Twenty-four.’

    knew that. They wanted to see if you were actually willing to live like us. If

    of the problem domain. Yes, this is asymmetric. That’s because the situation is
    asymmetric; you’re building the software to solve a problem, the problem hasn’t
    been created so that you can write some software. That’s just the way it is, and
    compromises must come more from the software makers than from the people we’re
    working for. The better you understand the problem you’re trying to solve, the

    toddler can be to your advantage. The domain experts are likely to have particular
    ways of doing things; finding out why is what’s going to uncover the stuff they
    didn’t think to tell you. It’ll be frustrating. Some things we don’t have real
    reasons for doing; they’re just “best” practice or the way it gets done. Probing
    on these things will set up a cognitive dissonance which can lead people to get
    defensive; it’s important to let them know that you’re asking because you’re aware
    how much of an expert they are at this stuff and that you just need to understand
    the basics in order to do a good job by them.

    how to actively reduce the harm this person can do. He may even deserve full persona

    government are those that tend to be the most stigmatized and in which government’s
    role as a provider may be most evident—the visible means-tested policies. Repeated
    usage of these policies conveyed to recipients that government made a positive
    difference in their lives. Yet, beyond that, multiple uses of neither visible
    nor submerged policies appeared to have any bearing on enhanced attitudes about
    government. In the case of the means-tested variant of submerged policies, moreover,
    accumulated usage failed to mitigate more negative views of government, leaving
    recipients more resentful than others and assured only that they pay a fair amount
    of taxes. In sum, despite the considerable resources committed to each of these
    policy types, with modest exceptions, the impact of policy usage on citizens’
    perceptions appears to evaporate, at least over the long term. Specific policies
    may make a difference in attitudes, as some studies have shown, but accumulated
    memories of policy usage seem to exert little bearing on broad attitudes about
    government.

    individuals’ views about welfare. Antipathy to welfare policy derails many from
    adopting more salutary views about government; indeed, although “welfare as we

    now benefit from this program, its image lives on and continues to operate as
    a major force in driving hostility not only toward social provision but also toward

    many little things, while Barth’s theology was like a hedgehog, knowing one big
    thing. Bonhoeffer would side with the hedgehog, but he was in the fox’s seminar,
    and through his family and the Grunewald community, he had many ties with the
    fox. As a result of his intellectual openness, Bonhoeffer learned how to think
    like a fox and respect the way foxes thought, even though he was in the camp of
    the hedgehogs.

  content: "have long thought that sermons had a center that, if you hit it, would
    move anyone or confront them with a decision. I no longer believe that. First
    of all, a sermon can never grasp the center, but can only itself be grasped by
    it, by Christ. And then Christ becomes flesh as much in the word of the pietists
    as in that of the clerics or of the religious socialists, and these empirical
    connections actually pose difficulties for preaching that are absolute, not merely
    relative.\r\n This was a very radical and dramatic thing to say, but it is the
    perfectly logical conclusion to the idea that apart from God’s grace, one can
    do nothing worthwhile. Anything good must come from God, so even in a sermon that
    was poorly written and delivered, God might manifest himself and touch the congregation.
    Conversely in a sermon wonderfully written and delivered, God might refuse to
    manifest himself. The “success” of the sermon is utterly dependent on the God
    who breaks through and “grasps” us, or we cannot be “grasped.” There was a foreshadowing
    of Bonhoeffer’s famous “Jeremiah” sermon a few years hence, and of his attitude
    toward his fate under the Nazis. What did it mean to be “grasped” by God? And
    why did Bonhoeffer already begin to have a deep sense that God had “grasped him,”
    had chosen him for something?"

    can act towards the state.” The first, already mentioned, was for the church to
    question the state regarding its actions and their legitimacy—to help the state
    be the state as God has ordained. The second way—and here he took a bold leap—was
    “to aid the victims of state action.” He said that the church “has an unconditional
    obligation to the victims of any ordering of society.” And before that sentence
    was over, he took another leap, far bolder than the first—in fact, some ministers
    walked out—by declaring that the church “has an unconditional obligation to the
    victims of any ordering of society, even if they do not belong to the Christian
    community.”

    to the one who had made us, which was the fulfillment of our destiny.

    that it is only by living completely in this world that one learns to have faith.
    . . . One must completely abandon any attempt to make something of oneself, whether
    it be a saint, or a converted sinner, or a churchman (a so-called priestly type!),
    a righteous man or an unrighteous one, a sick man or a healthy one. By this-worldliness
    I mean living unreservedly in life’s duties, problems, successes and failures,
    experiences and perplexities. In so doing we throw ourselves completely into the
    arms of God, taking seriously not our own sufferings, but those of God in the
    world—watching with Christ in Gethsemane. That, I think, is faith; that is metanoia;*
    and that is how one becomes a man and a Christian (cf. Jer. 45!). How can success
    make us arrogant, or failure lead us astray, when we share in God’s sufferings
    through a life of this kind? I think you see what I mean, even though I put it

  content: Goffman observes the difference between doing something and expressing
    the doing of something, between feeling something and conveying a feeling. “The
    representation of an activity will vary in some degree from the activity itself
    and therefore inevitably misrepresent it,” Goffman writes. (Take the experience
    of enjoying a sunset versus the experience of communicating to an audience that
    you’re enjoying a sunset, for example.) The internet is engineered for this sort
    of misrepresentation; it’s designed to encourage us to create certain impressions
    rather than allowing these impressions to arise “as an incidental by-product of
    [our] activity.” This is why, with the internet, it’s so easy to stop trying to
    be decent, or reasonable, or politically engaged—and start trying merely to seem
    so.

    collapse would do it, or perhaps a series of antitrust cases followed by a package
    of hard regulatory legislation that would somehow also dismantle the internet’s
    fundamental profit model. At this point it’s clear that collapse will almost definitely
    come first. Barring that, we’ve got nothing except our small attempts to retain
    our humanity, to act on a model of actual selfhood, one that embraces culpability,
    inconsistency, and insignificance. We would have to think very carefully about
    what we’re getting from the internet, and how much we’re giving it in return.
    We’d have to care less about our identities, to be deeply skeptical of our own
    unbearable opinions, to be careful about when opposition serves us, to be properly
    ashamed when we can’t express solidarity without putting ourselves first. The
    alternative is unspeakable. But you know that—it’s already here.

  content: 'Long ago, before the first civilization that I saw rise and fall in those
    shared visions, everyone lived in scattered burrows all over the night, with no
    more than a hundred people per burrow. They wove their tendrils together when
    anyone wanted to share information about what she had seen, or done. Or somebody
    might come up with a simple idea that she shared with everyone else, like a way
    to harvest more roots and grubs to feed into the web where their children were
    developing. Or how to strengthen their barriers against iceslides and avalanches.
    And that’s when their greatest love story took place. These two people, who had
    grown up in different burrows, came together after some brutal ice storms drove
    them away from their homes. The two refugees became inseparable, and their tendrils
    were intertwined whenever they weren’t working or eating. They slept with their
    pincers wrapped around each other, in their own mossy nook where the cool air
    ran over their carapaces. Their dreams flowed back and forth between them, and
    their memories of fleeing their homes blended together until they almost shared
    the same past. Everyone else recoiled, because this couldn’t be healthy for them,
    plus they were excluding the rest of the community, which was hurtful. People
    tried to pry the two of them apart, physically, or sent one or the other of them
    on long errands outside the burrow. At last one of the oldest and most patient
    of the burrow’s residents decided to talk to both of them together, and find out
    exactly what perversion they had been drawn into—and then there were three of
    them. Entangled, inextricable. People began talking about evicting all three of
    them. What had seduced them into this unnatural closeness? A set of designs for
    a water wheel, using the nearby underground river to operate a crude mill that
    would help them separate out the poisonous part of some mushrooms that grew in
    the caves. This was such a complex idea that one person couldn’t invent it alone
    and then share it with everyone else—the concept needed to be shaped among two
    or more people, working together. They couldn’t even share it with the others
    until they had the concept. And these lovers had discovered a powerful thrill,
    a joy that went all the way down to their stomachs, in weaving a big idea together.
    Like some wild rapture, the sensation of helping others to imagine something bigger
    than yourselves. Somehow, this weird love story is the foundation of this community’s
    politics, or religion. Rose lingers on the oddest parts, like when they finally
    reveal their invention to the rest of the community, or the tenderness when the
    couple becomes a trio. I sense the echoes from all the countless other times that
    people have passed this legend around, and the lesson that comes with it: to join
    with others to shape a future is the holiest act. This is hard work, and it never
    stops being hard, but this collective dreaming/designing is the only way we get
    to keep surviving, and this practice defines us as a community. Even the other
    communities that live apart from the midnight city, scattered all over the night
    in smaller cities or towns, share this origin story.'

    and mission creep. To prevent this, the mission must be carefully refined and
    simplified so that it is explicitly clear and specifically focused to achieve
    the greater strategic vision for which that mission is a part. The mission must
    explain the overall purpose and desired result, or “end state,” of the operation.
    The frontline troops tasked with executing the mission must understand the deeper
    purpose behind the mission. While a simple statement, the Commander’s Intent is
    actually the most important part of the brief. When understood by everyone involved
    in the execution of the plan, it guides each decision and action on the ground.

    you to say that maybe I’m not the villain in all this, I would be grateful.” And
    there it was, at the end of his arguments: an unwillingness not just to take responsibility
    but to admit that responsibility might, in some place, in someone’s hands, exist.
    It was a consensus about the organization’s comfort level moving forward that
    stopped the reporting. It was a consensus about the organization’s comfort level
    moving forward that bowed to lawyers and threats; that hemmed and hawed and parsed
    and shrugged; that sat on multiple credible allegations of sexual misconduct and
    disregarded a recorded admission of guilt. That anodyne phrase, that language

    it was: ethnic cleansing by a leader who wanted to ensure his genetic line continued

    back to them, to what is in it for them,” I told him. “And how do I do that?”
    he asked. “How can I make them care about the company’s profits?” “You have to
    think it through,” I said. “It’s like this. If you can capture this data that
    you want, you will be able to better arm both technicians in the field and your
    salespeople, right?” “Absolutely. That’s the whole point,” the ops manager agreed.
    “And once the technicians and salespeople are armed, they can do a better job,
    right?” I continued. “Definitely,” he answered. “Okay,” I said. “Now follow me:
    Armed with this data, the technicians will be able to provide better and faster
    customer service, and the salespeople will be able to sell more product to more
    customers. When we provide better service and sell more products, our business
    grows. When our business grows, we make more money—” “That’s what I said! But
    how does that help?” the ops manager interrupted. “Listen,” I told him. “When
    the company makes more money, we can invest more money in advertising and infrastructure.
    Once we put more money into advertising and infrastructure, we will gain even
    more customers and be able to support them even better. The better we perform
    as a company, the more customers we acquire. The more customers we acquire, the
    more work there is for technicians, which means overtime and overtime pay. And
    once the company maxes that out, we will need more technicians. The more technicians
    we need, the more we have to pay them to be here. So this means down the line,
    we will increase pay for technicians, especially experienced ones. And lastly,
    the more technicians and clients we have, the more team leaders and regional supervisors
    we will need. This opens up a pathway to advancement for every technician at this
    company. So profitability of the company not only puts money into the pockets
    of the owners—which the frontline technicians probably don’t care too much about—but
    more important, it impacts the technicians directly: it opens up opportunity for
    more pay, higher salaries, and a pathway for career advancement. That’s the thread
    that ties all of this together and aligns everyone at the company—the corporate
    leadership team right down to the field technicians. That’s leadership.” The operations
    manager nodded. The light had come on. It was clear."

  content: "“Liberalism” had been a word Roosevelt used to organize his political
    movement. In 1932, a reporter asked Roosevelt to describe his political philosophy.
    Roosevelt called himself “a liberal.” This did not mean, as classical liberalism
    had meant in much of the previous era, protecting the rights of industrial barons
    using the rhetoric of self-sufficiency. It meant moral leadership, the willingness
    to address a civilizational crisis by updating the machinery of governance. A
    liberal, Roosevelt said, broke from the past, but not too quickly to provoke violence.23
    After the war, Berle would again redefine the term “liberal,” slowly changing
    it to mean a form of soft corporatism. He did this by using the Red Scare to centralize
    power over postwar policy development into a small network of planners and Ivy
    League intellectuals, what conservatives derisively called “eggheads.” Over the
    next twenty-five years, liberalism would come to mean a gentle form of elitism.
    And since Roosevelt had called himself a liberal, this became what Democratics
    increasingly believed the New Deal had been."

    tradition—tracing to the Revolution itself—that held that the great ideological
    conflict was between democracy and monopoly. “Americans may not have quarreled
    over profound ideological matters,” he wrote early in his career, “as these are
    formulated in the history of political thought, but they quarreled consistently
    enough over issues that had real pith and moment.” Pith and moment was a beautiful
    phrase, but what Hofstadter meant was that there were no conflicts in America
    in political economy, only social anxiety. It was too scary for Hofstadter to
    concede that democratic movements were anything but a rabid mob.57

    of commerce as long as the consumer was protected.45 “People first had to get

    The goal was to “replace corporations, break them up,” so they could be “owned
    by workers or better yet consumers.” In truth, Nader had not thought carefully
    about who would control commerce.46

    Robinson-Patman Act since the laws were passed. The laws aimed at two different
    price harms. The first was predation, where a corporation like Standard Oil or
    A&P could use discounting to drive competitors out of business. The second was
    price discrimination, where a railroad or corporation could charge different prices
    to favor bigger companies that did their bidding. Both predation and price discrimination
    helped companies with access to capital, which meant that these tactics placed
    control over commerce in the hands of the money trust of Wall Street. The antimonopoly
    laws were designed to block both harms, and thus, restrict Wall Street. But predatory
    practices and price discrimination can lower prices for consumers, at least on
    a temporary basis.

  content: by the end of the 1980s, Wall Street had permanently changed corporate
    America. A new type of business model existed. The leveraged buyout industry,
    stung with bad publicity, rebranded as “private equity.” While some PE firms made
    productive investments, they were largely pools of floating capital that sought
    to use the corporation for the purpose of the financier.50 Strategically, the
    only businesses that were sustainable in the new legal environment were those
    that could withstand the pressures of financial raiders. Large-scale monopolistic
    corporations such as General Electric and Walmart could use the new tools to their
    advantage. So could high-tech concerns such as Microsoft that had taken advantage
    of the technology revolution to acquire choke holds over new vital arteries of
    commerce. Private equity firms and financial intermediaries who could use the
    new capital market structure to their advantage increasingly controlled American
    business. In previous eras in American history, the wreckage caused by such widespread
    looting would have led to substantial legal reforms. And there were some. But
    the key innovation, that the corporate structure exists as a mechanism for the
    extraction of cash for insiders from either the company itself or from a market
    that company monopolized, was here to stay.

  content: The Watergate Babies rejected the lessons of Patman’s generation for many
    reasons, conflating economic populism with an antiquated vision of the economy.
    But there was wisdom in Patman’s lessons. In the 1930s, he said that restricting
    chain stores would prevent “Hitler’s methods of government and business in Europe”
    from coming to the United States. For decades after World War II, preventing economic
    concentration was understood as a bulwark against tyranny. From the 1970s until
    the financial crisis, this rhetoric seemed ridiculous. No longer. Financial crises
    occur regularly now, and prices for essential goods and services reflect monopoly
    power rather than free citizens buying and selling to each other. People worldwide,
    sullen and unmoored from community structures, are turning to rage, apathy, protest,
    and angry tribalism. The reason for this dissatisfaction, the anxiety, is clear.
    The institutions that touch our lives are unreachable. We organize our social
    networks through Facebook, our information through Google, our health care from
    complex bureaucracies, our seeds and chemicals through seed monopolists. We sell
    our grain through Cargill and watch movies, buy groceries, books, and clothing
    through Amazon. Open markets are gone, replaced by a handful of corporate giants.
    We are increasingly addicted to opioids, sugary processed foods, and alcohol.
    We have no faith in what was once the most democratically responsive part of government,
    Congress. We cannot begin to address perhaps the most important existential challenge
    humanity has ever faced, climate change. Steeped in centralized power and mistrust,
    people all over the world face demagogues selling blame and hatred. But even more
    profound than the anxiety is the confusion. Our policymakers, until recently,
    saw giants like Google, Amazon, and Goldman Sachs as exemplars of the American
    spirit, instead of the dangerous re-creation of trading corporations seeking to
    control and enslave us—like the East India Company—against which we rebelled.
    They confused charity for justice, meekly asking our munificent plutocrats to
    raise our wages or donate their ill-gotten gains to charitable foundations plastered
    with their names. We have asked for new laws to offer welfare to the poor, instead
    of seeing poverty itself as a lack of freedom, as a denial of the basic rights
    of citizenship. This is not democracy. This is servitude.

    of the technocrat is “imposter syndrome,” a feeling that he or she doesn’t belong
    in a position of power, that his or her expertise is a pretense. This insecurity
    is what Aaron Director identified as his key to power. “Beautiful smugness” is
    how John Kenneth Galbraith and Richard Hofstadter persuaded a generation to give
    up their liberties. These men, Director in particular, understood that powerful
    liberal lawyers, well-respected and arrogant, were susceptible to mockery by their
    colleagues. Director made fun of lawyers who subscribed to common sense, creating
    a social context where an embrace of complex-seeming models by credentialed experts
    who were working for oligarchs overrode respect for justice, democracy, or basic
    human decency. In doing this, Director reoriented the elitist liberal brain, rewiring
    it for plutocracy without liberals even knowing. The only immunization against
    this is a democratic form of populism. I do not mean the toxic fake version of
    populism, demagogues and frauds blaming ethnic groups. I mean old-school populism,
    the belief that citizens, educated and responsible, know what is best for themselves.
    And united they come together in a system of democracy and use the law to protect
    and develop themselves. This populism does not disdain expertise, but embraces
    it. But expertise must serve the people; it must not be oriented to confuse them,
    to erect a new aristocracy. And that means you must never be afraid to say “I
    don’t know,” and you must do your best to remember that men in suits with impressive
    credentials can and often do lie, cheat, and steal. It’s true that humanity has
    a remarkable amount of accumulated knowledge, but as individuals, we’re all making
    it up as we go along. To do the work of being a citizen, each of us has to work
    hard, learn, build up a working body of knowledge.

    — Historian Timothy Snyder has spent much of his career examining the terror waged
    against the people of Eastern Europe between 1930 and 1945 in the borderlands
    between World War II–era Germany and the Soviet Union. His book Bloodlands chronicles
    the twin genocides perpetrated by Hitler and Stalin in modern-day Poland, Ukraine,
    Lithuania, Belarus, and western Russia—campaigns of ethnically and politically
    motivated mass killing and starvation writ large. Snyder implores his readers
    to view the staggering number of deaths—fourteen million—as fourteen million times
    one. “Each record of death,” he writes, “suggests, but cannot supply, a unique
    life. We must be able not only to reckon the number of deaths but to reckon with
    each victim as an individual.” Snyder explains that “to join in a large number
    after death is to be dissolved into a stream of anonymity. To be enlisted posthumously
    into competing national memories, bolstered by the numbers of which your life
    has become a part, is to sacrifice individuality. It is to be abandoned by history.”
    Snyder ends his book with a plea to academics and fellow historians, to all those
    who grapple with death on a grand scale. “It is for us as scholars,” he urges,
    “to seek these numbers and to put them into perspective. It is for us as humanists
    to turn the numbers back into people.”

    don’t understand, I told her. It’s like when you were on the border, she said.
    All those years I knew things were weighing on you, but you were so sensitive
    to my questions—I couldn’t ask about it, I couldn’t show concern, I could never
    reach you. I don’t want that again. I’m too tired for it now. I stood for a while
    at the side of the street, staring out at the houses of my neighbors. Finally,
    I sat down on the curb. When did you know? I asked. She paused. Something had
    gone away from our conversations, she said. I don’t know how to describe it. She
    searched for a better explanation. There’s a story I remember from Catholic school,
    she told me. There was this brilliant child, a music prodigy. He could play anything—he
    would hear birds sing and then turn it into music. At a very young age he was
    sent away to be trained by monks. When he arrived at the monastery they forbade
    him from hearing any music but his own, they forbade him from listening to any
    of the famous composers. They wanted him to write and create his own music, and
    for many years he did—he created the most phenomenal things. But as he got a bit
    older he became frustrated. He wanted to study, he wanted to hear other kinds
    of music. And so one day he snuck away from the monastery. He went to a nearby
    town and went into a concert hall, where he heard Mozart. When he came back, he
    didn’t tell anyone, he kept creating new music just like before. A few days after
    his return, the monks heard him playing and they told him to stop. You’ve broken
    the rule, they told him. He looked at them with panic and insisted, no I haven’t,
    I haven’t, I haven’t. They shook their heads and said, yes you have, you’ve discovered
    Mozart. No, he said, how could you know that? Because, they said, when you played
    without knowing, you played music from every composer—and now Mozart is missing.
    When she finished the story, my mother fell silent. I sat hunched on the curb,
    the phone pressed against my ear. My friend, I finally told her, he’s been deported.
    I felt unable to breathe. I fear for him, I said, I fear for his family. All these
    years, I told her, it’s like I’ve been circling beneath a giant, my gaze fixed
    upon its foot resting at the ground. But now, I said, it’s like I’m starting to
    crane my head upward, like I’m finally seeing the thing that crushes.

    four years on the border, she said. You weren’t just observing a reality, you
    were participating in it. You can’t exist within a system for that long without
    being implicated, without absorbing its poison. And let me tell you, it isn’t
    something that’s just going to slowly go away. It’s part of who you’ve become.
    So what will you do? All you can do is try to find a place to hold it, a way to

    I’ve opted for interpretation and analysis rather than objection and critique.
    I’ve included dissenting voices—either my own or those of other justices or analysts
    in the media and academe—only when they amplify lines of argument or assumption
    in Thomas’s jurisprudence that might otherwise be inaudible. As a longtime reader
    of the right from the left, I know how tempting it is for people on one side of
    the spectrum to dismiss those on the other as unthinking defenders of partisan
    advantage. Because the temptation to dismiss is even greater in Thomas’s case—perversely
    mimicking the dismissal of Marshall—and because it’s sufficiently difficult to
    get people to believe that Thomas has a jurisprudence, much less to hear it, the
    imperative to let him speak without the interruption of easy criticisms is that
    much more acute. Thomas’s is a voice that unsettles. His beliefs are disturbing,
    even ugly; his style is brutal. I want to make us sit with that discomfort rather
    than swat it away. This is not so that we adopt Thomas’s views, but so we see
    the world through his eyes—and realize, perhaps to our surprise, that his vision
    is in some ways similar to our own. Which should unsettle us even more.

    their dignity (any more than they lost their humanity) because the government
    allowed them to be enslaved,” Thomas wrote in one opinion. “Those held in internment
    camps did not lose their dignity because the government confined them. And those
    denied governmental benefits certainly do not lose their dignity because the government
    denies them those benefits. The government cannot bestow dignity, and it cannot
    take it away.”52

  content: EVEN IF AFRICAN Americans achieve power in the electoral realm, Thomas
    says, the state cannot deliver the transformation they seek. The disparity between
    the extent of black problems and the paucity of liberal solutions is too great.
    This claim of Thomas’s follows the conservative logic of what social theorist
    Albert Hirschman calls “the futility thesis,” which holds that any political attempt
    to alter a specific social condition will be “largely surface, façade, cosmetic,
    hence illusory, as the ‘deep’ structures of society remain wholly untouched.”
    As Hirschman points out, futilitarian arguments on the right often resemble structural
    arguments on the left. The latter are meant to portray reformist efforts as insufficiently
    radical, mere salves to social wounds that cannot be healed without a revolutionary
    transformation. It’s no surprise, then, that Thomas’s critique on the Court sounds
    similar to the critiques he deployed as a younger man. The difference is that
    the claim from the right is made not on behalf of a change that has yet to occur
    but against a change that already has been tried.18 The futility thesis preys
    upon the disappointment that so often comes in the wake of a large effort, the
    feeling that the change is not great enough, the transformation not deep enough,
    to justify all the sacrifice that went into its making. As we’ve seen, Thomas’s
    conservative critique also speaks to the pervasive sense that nothing much was
    achieved through the black freedom struggle. The disrepair was—is—too great for
    the state to fix.

  content: 'THOMAS’S CLAIM THAT the state cannot do anything for African Americans
    seems at odds with his claim that the state will make things worse for African
    Americans. Such contradiction is not his alone. As Hirschman points out, conservatives
    often invoke two other theses, in addition to futility, against reformist or radical
    political action. One is the “perversity thesis,” which holds that “the attempt
    to push society in a certain direction will result in its moving … in the opposite
    direction”: “any purposive action to improve some feature of the political, social,
    or economic order only serves to exacerbate the condition one wishes to remedy.”
    The other is the “jeopardy thesis,” which holds that “the cost of the proposed
    change or reform is too high as it endangers some previous, precious accomplishment.”
    Unlike the futility thesis, the theses of perversity and jeopardy assume that
    state action can have an impact, albeit a negative one. Though making a simultaneous
    case for futility and perversity, or futility and jeopardy, seems like a challenge—affirming
    the state’s potency and impotence in the same breath—an agonized conscience of
    consistency does not seem to trouble opponents of political transformation. Whenever
    futilitarians are not “quite comfortable with their own argument,” says Hirschman,
    “they look to the perverse effect for reinforcement, adornment, and closure.”30
    That is certainly the case with Thomas’s dissent in Kelo v. City of New London
    (2005), which used arguments of both perversity and jeopardy to oppose state projects
    of social reform.'

    to bring together the separate and discrete economies of the states into a single,
    integrated national economy—much the way the European Union is now doing for the
    separate economies of the continent’s nation-states—Marshall argued for a broad
    interpretation of the Commerce Clause.48 Commerce should be understood not in
    limited terms, he said, as only the buying and selling of goods, but as a social
    activity that transcends simple business transactions. “Intercourse,” Marshall
    called it, invoking an eighteenth-century conception, popular among the Framers,
    of commerce as interactions between diverse people across the globe. Commerce
    was a way of being social, of living with others in a single civilization; it
    was a dialogue among strangers. Among the definitions of commerce cited in Samuel
    Johnson’s Dictionary was “interchange of anything.”49 That “anything” could be
    commodities, texts, or opinions. Any proper reading of the term would include
    a great many activities beyond the buying and selling of goods.

    Leagues, no Freedmen’s Bureau, no interracial politics and parties. There is only

    is the keystone of the constitutional transformation that emancipation has wrought.

    ardent proponents say that it functions best when it is untouched by democracy,
    when it is protected from the conscious and collective interference of citizens
    acting through their government. And while for a brief stretch of the twentieth
    century the Constitution was envisioned as a living experiment, a text to be revised

    a way of maintaining our spot at the top of our imaginary ladder. Scientists,
    de Waal points out, can be some of the worst offenders—employing technical language
    to distance the other animals from us. They call “kissing” in chimps “mouth-to-mouth
    contact”; they call “friends” between primates “favorite affiliation partners”;
    they interpret evidence showing that crows and chimps can make tools as being
    somehow qualitatively different from the kind of toolmaking said to define humanity.
    If an animal can beat us at a cognitive task—like how certain bird species can
    remember the precise locations of thousands of seeds—they write it off as instinct,
    not intelligence. This and so many more tricks of language are what de Waal has
    termed “linguistic castration.” The way we use our tongues to disempower animals,
    the way we invent words to maintain our spot at the top.'

    Yes. Is there housing enough for all? There could be, there is no real problem
    there. Same for clothing. Is there health care enough for all? Not yet, but there
    could be; it’s a matter of training people and making small technological objects,
    there is no planetary constraint on that one. Same with education. So all the
    necessities for a good life are abundant enough that everyone alive could have
    them. Food, water, shelter, clothing, health care, education. Is there enough
    security for all? Security is the feeling that results from being confident that
    you will have all the things listed above, and your children will have them too.
    So it is a derivative effect. There can be enough security for all; but only if
    all have security. If one percent of the humans alive controlled everyone’s work,
    and took far more than their share of the benefits of that work, while also blocking
    the project of equality and sustainability however they could, that project would
    become more difficult. This would go without saying, except that it needs saying.
    To be clear, concluding in brief: there is enough for all. So there should be
    no more people living in poverty. And there should be no more billionaires. Enough
    should be a human right, a floor below which no one can fall; also a ceiling above
    which no one can rise. Enough is a good as a feast— or better. Arranging this

    The benefit from this simple extension was that it caused them to think at the
    next higher level. The OODs needed to think like the captain, and so on down the
    chain of command. In effect, by articulating their intentions, the officers and
    crew were acting their way into the next higher level of command. We had no need

    was, at times, the only thing that made me feel like my life was going to be okay.
    The thing he wrote that gave me the most courage was this: “Try your best to make
    goodness attractive. That’s one of the toughest assignments you’ll ever be given.”
    I made up my mind that even though goodness was considered a vice at Uber, and
    aggression considered its greatest virtue, I would still care about goodness,
    about kindness, about gentleness. I was determined to bring those virtues into
    work every single day, into every one of my meetings, into every moment of my
    life. I would be in the world, but I certainly wouldn’t be of it—just as my father
    had counseled, all those years ago. It wasn’t easy. Whenever people at work insulted
    me, I had to keep my cool; I’d take a deep breath and tell myself that they were
    merely ignorant of the fact that what they were doing was wrong. But my renewed
    Stoicism wasn’t just about turning the other cheek. It also came with responsibility:
    as someone who knew what was right and wrong, the Stoics taught, I was obligated
    to always do what was right. I began calling out sexism, racism, and bullying
    when they happened, just as I had back when I was a bar raiser. If I noticed someone
    being a bully toward others, I brought it up to management and insisted that they
    take action to stop it. Every time something ridiculous happened, every time a
    sexist email was sent, I’d send a short report to HR, just to keep a record going.
    When coworkers came to me for help, I tried my best to coach them on how to address
    the mistreatment they received from sexist and racist managers, how to document
    discrimination, how to escalate things to HR, how to escalate things to Uber’s
    executives, and—when that failed—how to escalate things to government and legal
    authorities (by contacting, for example, the EEOC). On days when I felt afraid,
    when I was worried for my coworkers or my job or my mental health, I would open
    my copy of Epictetus’s Enchiridion on the BART ride home. “When you have decided
    that a thing ought to be done, and are doing it, never avoid being seen doing
    it, though the many shall form an unfavorable opinion about it,” Epictetus said.
    “For if it is not right to do it, avoid doing the thing; but if it is right, why
    are you afraid of those who shall find fault wrongly?” His words gave me courage
    to stand up against the bullying from Uber’s management. On really bad days, I
    would pull the book out in between meetings, reading as I walked up and down the
    halls of Uber’s headquarters, sometimes walking past Travis Kalanick, who would
    be pacing around the building, talking on his phone. I started to feel that I
    had more control over my life. By defining myself in terms of my character—which
    was completely in my power—instead of letting my managers define me, I was able
    to slowly repair my sense of self-worth. Though the way I and others were being
    treated didn’t change, I was managing to weather the abuse better, to remain focused
    on my work, to begin planning for and dreaming of a life after Uber. As always,
    there was plenty to do: software architecture to review, microservices to fix,
    code to debug, new engineers to teach, colleagues to help. In the evenings, I
    worked on my microservices book, hoping I could put it all together in time for
    its scheduled Christmas publication date.'

  content: On another level, I always tried to give each player the freedom to carve
    out a role for himself within the team structure. I’ve seen dozens of players
    flame out and disappear not because they lacked talent but because they couldn’t
    figure out how to fit into the cookie-cutter model of basketball that pervades
    the NBA. My approach was always to relate to each player as a whole person, not
    just as a cog in the basketball machine. That meant pushing him to discover what
    distinct qualities he could bring to the game beyond taking shots and making passes.
    How much courage did he have? Or resilience? What about character under fire?
    Many players I’ve coached didn’t look special on paper, but in the process of
    creating a role for themselves they grew into formidable champions. Derek Fisher
    is a prime example. He began as a backup point guard for the Lakers with average
    foot speed and shooting skills. But he worked tirelessly and transformed himself
    into an invaluable clutch performer and one of the best leaders I’ve ever coached.

  content: In a nutshell, the Buddha taught that life is suffering and that the primary
    cause of our suffering is our desire for things to be different from the way they
    actually are. One moment, things may be going our way, and in the next moment
    they’re not. When we try to prolong pleasure or reject pain, we suffer. On the
    bright side, the Buddha also prescribed a practical way for eliminating craving
    and unhappiness by following what he called the Noble Eightfold Path. The steps
    were right view, right thinking, right speech, right action, right livelihood,
    right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. I thought the teachings
    might help explain what we were trying to do as a basketball team. RIGHT VIEW—involves
    looking at the game as a whole and working together as a team, like five fingers
    on a hand. RIGHT THINKING—means seeing yourself as part of a system rather than
    as your own one-man band. It also implies going into each game with the intention
    of being intimately involved with what’s happening to the whole team because you’re
    integrally connected to everyone on it. RIGHT SPEECH—has two components. One is
    about talking positively to yourself throughout the game and not getting lost
    in aimless back talk (“I hate that ref,” “I’m going to get back at that bastard”).
    The second is about controlling what you say when you’re talking with others,
    especially your teammates, and focusing on giving them positive feedback. RIGHT
    ACTION—suggests making moves that are appropriate to what’s happening on the floor
    instead of repeatedly showboating or acting in ways that disrupt team harmony.
    RIGHT LIVELIHOOD—is about having respect for the work you do and using it to heal
    the community rather than simply to polish your ego. Be humble. You’re getting
    paid a ridiculous amount of money to do something that’s really simple. And fun.
    RIGHT EFFORT—means being unselfish and exerting the right amount of energy to
    get the job done. Tex Winter says that there’s no substitute for hustle, and my
    addendum is, if you don’t hustle, you’ll get benched. RIGHT MINDFULNESS—involves
    coming to every game with a clear understanding of our plan of attack, including
    what to expect from our opponents. It also implies playing with precision, making
    the right moves at the right times, and maintaining constant awareness throughout
    the game, whether you’re on the floor or on the bench. RIGHT CONCENTRATION—is
    about staying focused on what you’re doing at any given moment and not obsessing
    about mistakes you’ve made in the past or bad things that might happen in the
    future. What

    always been the temptations of the NBA life. Many young players get so seduced
    by the money and fame that they never develop into mature young men or live up
    to their promise as athletes. In my view, the key to becoming a successful NBA
    player is not learning the coolest highlight-reel moves. It’s learning how to
    control your emotions and keep your mind focused on the game, how to play through
    pain, how to carve out your role on the team and perform it consistently, how
    to stay cool under pressure and maintain your equanimity after crushing losses
    or ecstatic wins. In Chicago we had a phrase for this: going from a basketball
    player to a “professional” NBA player.'

  content: In the past Kobe had led mostly by example. He’d worked harder than anyone
    else, rarely missed a game, and expected his teammates to play at his level. But
    he hadn’t been the sort of leader who could communicate effectively and get everyone
    on the same page. If he talked to his teammates, it was usually, “Give me the
    damn ball. I don’t care if I’m being double-teamed.” That approach usually backfired.
    As Luke describes it, “I’ve got Kobe on the floor yelling at me to give him the
    ball. And I’ve got Phil on the bench telling me to make the right pass no matter
    what. So instead of just seeing what’s happening on the court, I’m trying to take
    in Kobe yelling and Coach telling me not to pass to him. And it made my job a
    lot harder.” But then Kobe started to shift. He embraced the team and his teammates,
    calling them up when we were on the road and inviting them out to dinner. It was
    as if the other players were now his partners, not his personal spear-carriers.
    Luke noticed the change. Suddenly, Kobe was reaching out to him in a much more
    positive way than before. If Luke was bummed about missing three straight shots,
    Kobe would say, “C’mon, man, don’t worry about that shit. I miss three straight
    shots every fucking game. Just keep shooting. The next one’s going to go in.”
    Says Luke, “When your leader is telling you that, instead of giving you a death
    stare, it makes the next shot a lot easier to take.”

    They can go in and take a shower, then come out and say, “I’m tired and hungry.
    Let’s go get something to eat.” But coaches don’t have the same kind of release
    that comes from playing a grueling physical game. Our nervous systems tend to
    keep firing long after the arena has cleared. For me, the nerves usually kick
    into high gear in the middle of the night. I’ll sleep for a few hours, then—bang!—my
    brain is up and spinning. “Should I have done this, should I have done that? God,

  content: This calling is not unlike the traditional Christian concept of living
    in grace. In October I went to a panel discussion on the ascetic life at Loyola
    Marymount College led by a friend, author Kathleen Norris. She told a story about
    a monk in the Middle Ages who traveled to a nearby city to visit a famous ascetic
    who turned out to be a merchant living in a busy market district. That night,
    while they were praying, the monk was rattled by the noise some drunks and prostitutes
    were making in the street and asked the merchant “How on earth can you stand this
    every night?” The merchant replied, “I just say to myself, ‘They’re all going
    to the kingdom.’” Kathleen, who is a devout Christian, told this story because
    she often uses it in her own practice. Once when she was staying in a private
    club in Chicago, the man next door came back to his room with a call girl and
    they started making an unholy racket. “I had to make a choice between being disturbed
    or not disturbed,” she said. “Then I remembered this story and just said to myself,

    for itself and requires effective advocates on its behalf. Folks who successfully
    advance technology are pragmatic, deliberate, and focus more on the long-term

    many, was already more rewarding than such arduous labor might seem. Here’s how
    Mike Howard described working in the open-hearth furnace to Mark Reutter: “I felt
    good. When you’re in your prime, physical work is a challenge, and if you’re working
    with other people, there is a certain pride in being on top of the job. The demands
    of the work bred a kind of man who was fiercely committed to this work.” Howard
    distinguished between “brutalizing work” and “challenging work”: “In the open
    hearth, you had to cope with problems that involved metallurgy, that involved
    blacksmithing, that involved judgment. These were not guys who were a bunch of
    punch-drunk wrestlers. They were bright. There were split-second decisions that
    had to be made. There were a lot of challenges that kept you on your toes.”'

    your seniority and your ability, and not have these here bosses’ pets and brown-nosers
    get the best jobs. We got more money, that was important, sure, but we got respect

    of a good, as opposed to just one seller, a monopoly. In this case, the good being
    labor: the bigger Amazon got and the more it dominated local labor markets, the
    less competition it faced for workers, and the less it needed to pay to hire them.
    As recently as 2012, the company had had only 88,000 employees worldwide. But
    over the rest of the decade, it would grow with astonishing speed, making it the
    second-largest private-sector employer in the country after Walmart, and making
    monopsony a real prospect. By late 2019, it had more than 750,000 employees worldwide
    and 400,000 employees in the United States, the overwhelming majority of them
    in the company’s more than two hundred fulfillment centers, sortation centers,
    and other delivery facilities. In 2017 alone, the company grew by 130,000 worldwide;
    in the summer of 2019, it hired 97,000, nearly the entire workforce of Google.
    And this was before the hiring spree that would arrive with the global pandemic
    of the spring of 2020. Warehousing and distribution used to be considered somewhat
    higher-skilled jobs: one could make over $20 per hour and stay years at a time.
    At Amazon, it was a more fleeting existence. Workers tended to be younger. Turnover
    was exceedingly high. And the seasonal workforce was often literally transient,

    makes me literally “undisciplined.” This news was very freeing, and a gift I wish
    I had been handed decades before. I now am able to ask you to read this book the
    way you would watch a play: not to emerge saying, “The play is right!” but rather
    to observe that the play reveals human nuance, contradiction, limitation, joy,
    connection, and the tragedy of separation. That the playwright’s own humanity
    is also an example of these unavoidable flaws. These chapters are not homogenous.
    As a creative writer I have long understood that form should be an organic expression
    of the feelings at the core of the piece. Each chapter here serves a different
    function and that is represented in its tone, genre, style, and form. Some are
    journalistic, some analytical, some are speculative, others abstract, some are
    only feelings. As a novelist, I know that it is the cumulative juxtaposition that
    reveals the story. This is not a book to be agreed with, an exhibition of evidence
    or display of proof. It is instead designed for engaged and dynamic interactive
    collective thinking where some ideas will resonate, others will be rejected, and
    still others will provoke the readers to produce new knowledge themselves. Like
    authentic, conscious relationships, truly progressive communities, responsible
    citizenship, and real friendship, and like the peace-making that all these require,
    it asks you to be interactive.'

    which constructs avoidance as a right regardless of the harm it does to others.
    This negative standard persuades some people to feel that being uncomfortable
    signals that they are being Abused, because they don’t have the option of describing
    themselves as Conflicted. So asking a distressed person if they are unsafe, or
    rather, uncomfortable, angry, or hurt provides them with an alternative idea that
    might fit better with their actual experience. It not only elicits helpful information,

    of McCarthyism later on in their lives. He told me that some of his patients had
    found themselves caught up in the whirlwind smoke of shunning and innuendo, whisper
    campaigns and exclusions. No one ever sat down and told them what they were being
    accused of, and they never had a chance to discuss or inform or respond. Instead,
    group pressures, intimidations, and false loyalties produced a climate of mysterious
    chill, in which they were denied jobs, kept out of social events, shunned by acquaintances.
    People were mean to them without ever saying why, and no opportunity for clarification
    or repair was ever presented. These people found both the material and emotional
    consequences overwhelming, but even more so they were hurt by the amorphous nature
    of the problem. Not being able to know exactly what they were charged with, not
    being able to talk through the accusations, never knowing where they would face
    these hostile expressions drove many people to extreme suffering. Even later when
    classic McCarthyism was dismantled and delegitimized, these unnecessarily broken
    relationships could not be healed. My therapist explained to me that taking extreme
    bullying actions, like signing a petition against a friend, or denouncing a colleague
    to others or to the state, as often happened under McCarthyism, was so extreme
    in its pathology that the participants could never repair. They were so defended
    against the reality of the injustice of their own action that they couldn’t reconcile
    it to their false image of themselves as righteous. In listening to him, I came
    to believe that the same personality type who would ice out or attack someone
    without talking to them first out of false “loyalty” would be the same person
    who would later be unable to apologize. It’s a character issue that becomes the
    building blocks of fascism or any supremacist construction. And for those people,
    a commonly held expectation or standard of asking targeted people what they feel
    or how they understand their experience could be a life-enhancing or even life-saving
    corrective.

    later that year, “is committed to assuming that the victim is telling the truth,
    and any exploration around that trope is met with heavy resistance. Historically,
    that makes sense for a host of reasons. But this analysis is not about disbelieving,
    it’s about pinpointing where the problem lies.” One of Hodes’ many valuable suggestions
    is to lower the bar for what must happen in a person’s life for their suffering
    to be acknowledged. “The current paradigm is encouraging all of us to think we
    are in abusive relationships,” Hodes explained. “And if you are not in an abusive
    relationship, you don’t deserve help. Being ‘abused’ is what makes you ‘eligible.’
    But everyone deserves help when they reach out for it.” This is a strikingly humane
    idea: that the collapse of Conflict and Abuse is partly the result of a punitive
    standard in which people are made desperate, yet ineligible, for compassion. This
    is a non-cynical reading of a human condition in which people who have suffered
    in the past, or find themselves implicated in situations in which they are afraid
    to be accountable, fear that within their group acknowledging some responsibility
    will mean being denied their need to be heard and cared for. So they fall back
    on the accusation of Abuse to guarantee that they will not be questioned in a
    way that confirms these fears."

    about refusing male privilege in the world. But feminism, or full and complete
    personhood for women, is an idea. And each human being has to do the work to explore
    it, build a relationship to it, and understand what their own changes must be
    in order to be part of it. “On ne nait pas feminist, on le deviant” (one is not
    born a feminist, but becomes it), said Simone de Beauvoir. I know a man who advertises
    himself as an “eco-feminist,” but he expects his mother and her female partner
    to clean up after him. So actually he is neither eco nor a feminist. His mother
    thinks he is because in her birth family, women shopped, prepped, cooked, served,
    and cleaned up after men at every meal. Her son cooks his own eggs in the morning
    and sometimes makes them for her. So she believes he is a feminist, even though
    he often leaves the dirty pan in the sink. Politics is a consequence of how a
    person understands their experience. In that way, the son of a feminist is not
    a feminist. He may become one, but he would have to learn how not to exploit women,
    including his mother. And in this world, it is the responsibility of his peers
    to make sure he understands what that actually means. His friends have to parent
    him as well as his actual parents, because that is where real values are established,
    in the conflict between what our families tell us and the reality of the world.
    We have to be separate from our families in order to come to this evaluation,
    in which we build our own understandings and values, taken as much from critical
    understandings of what we have experienced as what we haven’t.

    favor by standing up for someone who is the object of everyone else’s blame, whether
    it is people with HIV, the homeless person on the subway, or our friend’s ex-girlfriend.
    Those of us who present ourselves as “progressive,” who support others, or help
    out, or take stands, are the ones most responsible for bucking the trend of cruelty.
    When we don’t refuse cruelty, ultimately we stand for nothing; we are hypocrites,
    and our public selves are phony. Progressive people do not shun, and in fact they
    intervene when group shunning is being organized. Finally, ultimately, when groups
    bond over shunning or hurting or blaming another person, it is the state’s power
    that is enhanced. Because the state doesn’t want to understand causes, because
    the state doesn’t want things to get better, it doesn’t want people to understand
    each other. State apparatuses are there to maintain the power of those in control
    and punish those who contest that power; that is what bad families do, and that
    is what bad friends do. And nothing disrupts dehumanization more quickly than
    inviting someone over, looking into their eyes, hearing their voice, and listening.

    Holocaust archives for guidance. The Shoah Foundation, organized by Steven Spielberg,
    had a structure that did not fit our needs. Designed to counter Holocaust revisionism,
    in which people who did not commit the Holocaust deny that it ever occurred, the
    project had hundreds of interviewers focused on a list of predetermined questions.
    We felt that the interviews were designed to emphasize the moments of trauma,
    of oppression and atrocity. As important as this was, we were more intrigued by
    a small archive financed by the Fortunoff department store family that investigated
    who each person was before the Holocaust, and then how they were impacted by the
    turn of events. This approach really appealed to us for a number of reasons. The
    primary purpose of the ACT UP Oral History Project, and of this book, is not to
    look back with nostalgia, but rather to help contemporary and future activists
    learn from the past so that they can do more effective organizing in the present.
    We wanted to show, clearly, what we had witnessed in ACT UP: that people from
    all walks of life, working together, can change the world.'

  content: Direct action was a concept by which theoretical discussion was not separate
    from action. Of course, individual ACT UPers were influenced by theory. A number
    of young video activists had studied in the Whitney Museum Studio Program. Many
    older activists came from highly theorized earlier radical movements, and some
    members, like Douglas Crimp, wrote theory. But on the floor of the Monday-night
    meeting, theory was never debated unless it was tied to creating actions, or to
    setting active campaigns. As Maxine Wolfe, one of ACT UP’s most influential leaders,
    would say, when planning and carrying out an action, “theory emerges” as a concrete
    result of actual decisions that are being made for real-life application. Instead
    of the Gramscian concept of “praxis,” which is the application of theory into
    practice, ACT UP first chose a practice—an action—and then evolved a theory necessary
    to make it work toward our larger goal of “direct action to end the AIDS crisis.”
    In this way campaigns were structured as a series of interconnected actions, designed
    to produce a larger outcome. ACT UP would never just do a demonstration, zap,
    or action to stand on its own. These public expressions were designed to build
    to the next step. That’s why every event had a sign-up sheet, or leaflets announcing
    further actions, and participants were informed of the next step in the series
    on any specific issue. Every action included a component of giving participants
    and observers something else to do. In this way, energy was not wasted, and events
    had purpose, as part of a larger schema. Not wasting energy, effort, or goodwill
    was essential to being effective in a movement of people who literally did not
    have time.

    to do good, and actually did in fact truly make the world a better place. Inside
    those accomplishments are realities of a human dimension: people who do great
    things also do bad things, sometimes out of bias and supremacy, and sometimes
    out of vulnerability, fear of demise, the desire to live, or all of the above.
    And when white people, and men, do things out of bias and vulnerability, people
    with less access pay a price. Sometimes that price is stress, or being forced
    to strategize, or being blindsided as a way of life. Sometimes that price is exclusion
    from treatments, from participation in decision-making, or from the machine of
    power. Sometimes that means death, and sometimes that means long-term and systemic
    deprivation for the collective as well as the individual. When we evaluate how
    we have spent our lives, we have to look at our cumulative impact, not at the
    moments of failure or bad faith. Assessing this history is not a game of call-out.
    Instead, it is an effort to really understand and make clear how the AIDS rebellion
    succeeded, and to face where it failed, in order to be more conscious and deliberate,

    from Chicago who had moved to New York to become an actor and who was working
    in Black gay theater with Assotto Saint. They decided to get together to “do a
    kind of activism that was not necessarily authorized by the large group.” They
    were annoyed by what they felt was a slow pace as ACT UP grappled to develop their
    perspective. They called themselves “MHA,” which actually didn’t stand for anything,
    but had flexible uses. For example, they used “Metropolitan Health Association”
    in order to get a meeting with Stephen Joseph, the health commissioner of New
    York City. At that time, Joseph was talking about various kinds of punitive measures
    against prostitutes. He had engaged in some “very panic-causing kinds of rhetoric”
    about the threat that people with AIDS, for whom he was considering internment
    and other repressive measures, caused to the general public, particularly around
    tuberculosis. MHA showed up. “We said, ‘We’re the Metropolitan Health Association.’
    They said, ‘Please come in.’” They were in a large conference room with Stephen
    Joseph. It quickly became apparent, though, that MHA was not any kind of interborough
    health consortium. They started asking Joseph about the slow pace in the city’s
    response to AIDS. When Joseph realized that they were AIDS activists, Gregg and
    company were arrested and the story appeared in the press. At the next ACT UP
    meeting, Gregg remembers rising and saying, “Look, you can just do this. You don’t
    have to go to the large group to get authorization. In fact, it’s better that
    the large group is not involved with these kinds of actions because they don’t
    have to be held accountable. So you can just do stuff. ACT UP is just this place
    we all meet on a weekly basis to talk about strategy and prioritize issues.” He
    remembered saying over and over again, You can just do this. Just go out and do
    this. And people were very enthusiastic. This happened at the same time that the
    concept of affinity groups, which were inherently autonomous from the larger body,
    was gaining more popularity in ACT UP.

    How do you get the press to pay attention? Ann laid out the fundamental points
    of doing media for a radical political movement: Well, first of all, you do plan
    an action that is interesting enough, that you think the press is going to care
    about it. But you have to woo the press. You have to find a way to get them there.
    Some of that is about writing a press release that you send to the press that’s
    interesting enough to make them look at it and say, Oh, I better go cover that—that’s
    going to be important or interesting or crazy, and will make good pictures and
    put wild people on television. But we also know that the press doesn’t generally
    read press releases, so don’t expect to get the press there, just by sending them
    a press release, because they’re going to throw it in the wastebasket, and you’re
    just going to have to do it all over again. So you have to call them. And you
    have to find the right person to speak to. So you have to know how to call a newspaper
    or television station and say—not ask to speak to a specific person, but say—I’m
    calling about this, who should I speak to? And let them tell you who to speak
    to. Then you have to know how to talk to that person, and how to present [the
    issue]. And you do it first by asking them questions, and saying, What do you
    know about this? What’s your opinion of such and such? Rather than just throwing
    something at them. And then, lead them into being interested about this, and say,
    Well, what you may not know is such and such. Or, We’re doing this, that you might
    find interesting, and sort of make them think it’s their idea to come do this,
    rather than haranguing them or lecturing them about—You should be there, and you
    should be covering this. That will make them sit home, guaranteed. Part of infiltrating
    the media’s messaging was through simple education, in the hopes of getting our
    message, and not the state’s, or the corporation’s, across. “The press was so
    stupid and so lazy, that they would come to every demonstration and ask one question:
    Why are you here? That was it. And they had no understanding of any issue, and
    no ability to ask questions about any issue. Ninety-five percent of any news story
    is what the reporter is saying. The sound bites are a very tiny part of any story.
    I would tell people, Watch the evening news, and time how much of a story is the
    reporter’s narration, and how much is the sound bite, and you’ll find that the
    sound bite is a very small portion of the story. So it’s far less important for
    you to come up with the right sound bite than it is for you to talk to the reporter
    before they do the story and educate them, so they will reflect your point of
    view in their narration.”'

    who thought that until they had AIDS, they thought that the government was out
    there, and working for them. And I went to an affinity group meeting with this
    guy, I don’t remember his name; and he said it, quite clear. And he was really
    serious. He said, I can’t believe that my government let me down. I had a good
    job, I had plenty of money. But when I got sick, the government let me down. I
    wasn’t getting the services, I got treated like a pariah. Then there was the other
    group—and it wasn’t only people of color; but there’s another group, I think it’s
    more of a class thing—who knew that the system stunk, and the system had been
    letting them down, for years … People with insurance were definitely feeling something
    different than people going in with Medicaid … There were people that socialized
    in ACT UP who would never, ever, in a million years, if it wasn’t that situation,
    even talk to each other on the street. “But I think that’s the thing that held
    the group together so long, and made it work. Even people you didn’t like in ACT
    UP, right—you would support them in some way, because you had the same issues …
    People were dying, it was urgent; a lot of people in the group were dying; and
    this was it. There was nowhere else to go but ACT UP. And I think some people
    came to ACT UP or they would have jumped out windows if they didn’t come to ACT
    UP, because it was also, in a way, some kind of therapy for people coming there.
    Whether you were rich or poor, that was one of the only places you could talk
    about your condition, your friend’s condition, whoever you were taking care of.
    That was the only place to talk about it. And I think that made an alliance that
    would have never happened anywhere else … And the anger was there. Everybody was
    pissed. They weren’t getting the services; most people were still treated like
    pariahs, in the beginning.”"

    remembered “The Moratorium” as a halt on all meetings between ACT UP and the government.
    But, actually, by the time it came to the floor for a vote, it was a halt on all
    meetings about women without group approval. Technically, this would not have
    affected T&D because they were not meeting with the government about women, and
    in a sense, the proposal was a recognition of defeat by the people working on
    women-with-AIDS issues, trying to systematize some kind of control of their own
    territory. As often happens, reality is too complex, and a false but easier to
    remember version of a moratorium proposal as punitive and sprawling has substituted
    for the historical reality.

  content: 'Fred Gealy23, in an essay called “Encounter and Dialogue”, suggests we
    begin our dialogue with sacred literature by first asking what the writer actually
    says, allowing authors to speak for themselves rather than beginning with our
    beliefs, assumptions or someone else’s interpretation. We let them “have their
    say.” We look for the actual words and phrases themselves. He then says we need
    to ask what happened in the story, because much of the world’s sacred literature
    takes a narrative form. We break out the steps taken and find the elements of
    a given story or passage. What were the events? He calls them “happenednesses.”
    He asks us to look at the historical, economic, political, social and cultural
    context. What was really going on? We find the objective occurrences and set them
    in context. We isolate and identify the human dynamics in the story. His next
    step suggests that we ask our own questions. In light of what happened in the
    stories, we surface the questions that are raised in our own very real lives today,
    the “existential questions” that strike deep into the core of our beings and raise
    foundational questions about our very nature. These are the questions that do
    not go away. They trigger an inquiry or a search for the answers that will enable
    us to consciously shape our lives. We draw relationships between the happenednesses
    and our own situation. It is easy to see this as two distinct steps: 1) a reflective
    self-examination, followed by 2) relating our own life experience to the story.
    It is only then, Gealy says, that it is appropriate to ask about the message we
    take from the story or text. How does it impact me in my real situation? How do
    I come up with answers to the questions I face? How do I determine my sense of
    identity and purpose? It is these pressing questions that focus the message and
    make it personal. It is the answers that provide a framework for authentic meaning
    and significance for each person. Gealy’s insights into applied phenomenology
    gave rise to ICA’s methods, first as study and teaching methodologies and later
    as the ToP facilitation methodologies. As they evolved, they were applied to all
    kinds of challenges in organisations and communities. The technology in the Technology
    of Participation (ToP) is the phenomenological method.   Phenomenology as method
      Combining the methods used in demythologizing with insights from Suzanne Langer24,
    Gealy and others led to the creation of a unique approach to phenomenological
    inquiry.'

    and valuable.” “The group needs the best wisdom available to make the wisest decisions.”
    “You can shape your situation and your world.” These ideas are integrated into
    ToP facilitation through a complex of values, practices and application of methodology.
    ToP facilitators often say these things directly because they are using a methodology
    that supports them. ToP methodology provides a process through which an individual
    or a group can pursue, in principle, any inquiry. It enables groups to examine
    their own images or pictures of a situation in relationship to a topic. Each participant
    contributes, from their own perspective, thoughts relevant to the question at
    hand. As the group reflects on the compilation of ideas, their picture of the
    situation grows, develops and changes. They make meaning together.

  content: The process of development and the formation of developmental strategy
    is a complex, interrelated whole that contains specific and very real polarities.
    At the most general level, there is a tension between the group’s vision for the
    future and the complex of factors that negate the vision or hinder its fulfillment.
    Seeing the specific barriers in relation to a vision enables a group to see their
    whole strategic situation and identify key underlying contradictions that must
    be addressed if they are to realize their vision. Naming those contradictions
    provides a platform for strategic thinking. This analysis provides insight into
    steps and strategic directions that can be taken to address the group’s situation
    in an authentic, future-oriented way. When they have identified their strategies,
    the group can create specific, practical action plans to implement their chosen
    strategies. This process has become known as the ToP Strategic Planning Method.
    ToP action planning rounds out the basic suite of ToP applications. The core of
    this method includes identifying a desired future state, analyzing the hindering
    and supporting factors in the present situation, naming concrete commitments given
    the present reality, generating actions toward those commitments, and timelining
    the actions with assignments and estimated costs. The ToP journey wall applies
    the charting approach to time and historical events to enable a group to look
    at, discuss, create a story of their journey, and learn from their past experience.

  content: 'In Western society, we struggle with articulating the reflective level.
    Reducing the reflective level questions to “How did this make you feel?” generates
    very little information, and many people avoid answering. More useful and appropriate
    information is elicited with several more specific questions, such as “What part
    of this made you uncomfortable, and which part were you pleased with?” Questions
    that elicit memories or past experiences can also be very helpful in allowing
    people to pay attention to their inner experience. The most successful interpretive
    questions are specifically crafted to explore insights in relation to the aim
    of the conversation. For example, if the aim is to understand a policy, one interpretive
    question may be “What implications might this policy have for our daily work?”
    Decisional level questions also work best when they are specific to the aim of
    the conversation. Sometimes a group decision is necessary, so articulating it
    is useful: “What have we decided to do?” Sometimes individual decisions are important:
    “What will you do next to apply what you’ve learned today?” Sometimes both are
    needed. Leaving the room without any decisional question will leave the group
    hanging and unsatisfied. If a decision is not possible, deciding not to decide
    and when to come back to the topic can be sufficient. After'

  content: Gestalt in this context is about seeing “‘patterns of meaning” in a whole
    set of ideas given in relation to a specific question. The individual responses
    to the focus question will, if the focus question is well-designed, be comprehensive
    in addressing the question. The task is to discern the major themes of thought
    or distinct answers to the given question. There may be many connections and associations
    among the ideas. There may be causes and effects. There may be words that are
    similar or seem to have similar meanings. The key factor in distilling useful
    meaning from this process is the question used as the guide, the focus question.
    It focuses the generation of ideas and guides discernment of the thought patterns
    of the responses. The question becomes the fundamental reference point for a whole
    inquiry and all of its parts. The patterns are named as the group’s response to
    the focus question. It must be understood that this is a process of synthesis
    rather than analysis. One of the easy temptations in performing this process is
    the tendency to sort elements into categories that are already integrated into
    our understanding even if they are not consciously identified. It is, without
    question, much easier for both the participant and the facilitator to sort into
    known categories, but sorting only organizes previous ideas, and does not create
    new ideas. Analytical methodologies play a necessary role in processing ideas
    when an overall framework is already firmly in place.

    from an early age. On Sesame Street they ask, “Which of these is not like the
    others?” It is easy to create categories and sort ideas into them, but no new
    knowledge or understanding is created, and “miscellaneous” categories are created,
    effectively marginalizing ideas that are different or outliers. In contrast, the
    consensus workshop method is best used to synthesize new ideas from a diversity
    of individual ideas. This approach completely sidesteps the question of agreeing
    or disagreeing with someone else’s idea; it asks how each unique idea can contribute
    to something the group has not seen before.

    and necessarily the longest, antithesis: a deconstruction of the state of OOP
    as it exists today. To get to the kernel of a good idea, you have to crack a few
    nuts. Part one is the agitation that necessarily precedes revolution. The second
    part, thesis: a reconstruction of OOP using only the parts that were left over
    after the antithesis. Part two is the manifesto: once we’ve seen that the last
    few decades of status quo haven’t been working for us, we can evaluate something
    that will. The third, synthesis: a discussion of the ideas from OOP that aren’t
    being provided by today’s object systems, and the ideas and problems that OOP
    doesn’t yet address at all. These are the next steps to take to pursue the ideas
    behind object thinking. Part three is the call to action. This is not a pure takedown,
    a suggestion that we have been monotonically doing it wrong for three decades:
    the antithesis part of this book questions, rejects and destroys a lot of built
    aspects of OOP, but by no means all of them. And by no means purely the later
    ones, either: the message is not that Smalltalk was created in some computational
    garden of Eden and that Sun tasted of the forbidden fruit which doomed us all
    to Java. Belief in a primaeval wisdom (urwissenheit) leads to an uncritical “tradition
    for tradition’s sake” in the same way that belief in primaeval stupidity (urdummheit)
    leads to an uncritical “novelty for novelty’s sake”. Rather this is an attempt
    to find a consistent philosophy, a way of thinking about software, and to find
    the threads in the narrative and dialectic history of the making of software that
    are supportive and unsupportive of that way of thinking. Because OOP is supposed
    to be a paradigm, a pattern of thought, and if we want to adopt that paradigm
    then we have to see how different tools or techniques support, damage, or modify
    our thoughts.'

    either instructs an object to do something (like add an element to a list) or
    asks the object for information (like the number of elements in a list) but never
    does both.

  content: 'Behaviour-Driven Development marries the technical process of Test-Driven
    Development with the design concept of the ubiquitous language, by encouraging
    developers to collaborate with the rest of their team on defining statements of
    desired behaviour in the ubiquitous language and using those to drive the design
    and implementation of the objects in the solution domain. In that way, the statement
    of what the Goal Donor needs is also the statement of sufficiency and correctness
    - i.e. the description of the problem that needs solving is also the description
    of a working solution. This ends up looking tautological enough not to be surprising.
    Constructing Independent Objects The theme running through the above is that sufficiency
    is sufficient. When an object has been identified as part of the solution to a
    problem, and contributes to that solution to the extent needed (even if for now
    that extent is “demonstrate that a solution is viable”), then it is ready to use.
    There is no need to situate the object in a taxonomy of inherited classes - but
    if that helps to solve the problem, then by all means do it. There is no need
    to show that various objects demonstrate a strict subtype relationship and can
    be used interchangeably, unless solving your problem requires that they be used
    interchangeably. There is no need for an object to make its data available to
    the rest of the program, unless the problem can be better solved (or cheaper solved,
    or some other desirable property) by doing so. I made quite a big deal above of
    the open-closed principle, and its suggestion that the objects we build be “open
    to modification”. Doesn’t that mean anticipating the ways in which a system will
    change and making it possible for the objects to flex in those ways? To some extent,
    yes, and indeed that consideration can be valuable. If your problem is working
    out how much to bill snooker players for their time on the tables in your local
    snooker hall, then it is indeed possible that your solution will be used in the
    same hall on the pool tables, or in a different snooker hall. But which of those
    will happen first, will either happen soon? Those are questions to work with the
    Goal Donor and the Gold Owner (the person paying for the solution) on answering.
    Is it worth paying to solve this related problem now, or not? Regardless of the
    answer, the fact is that the objects are still ready to go to work as soon as
    they address the problem you have now. And there are other ways to address related
    problems anyway, which don’t require “future-proofing” the object designs to anticipate
    the uses to which they may be put. Perhaps your SnookerTable isn’t open to the
    extension of representing a pool table too, but the rest of the objects in your
    solution can send messages to a PoolPlayer in its stead. As the variant on the
    Open-Closed Principle above showed, these other objects could be ignorant of the
    game played on the table. Some amount of planning is always helpful, whether or
    not the plan turns out to be. The goal at every turn should be to understand how
    we get to what we now want from what we have now, not to already have that which
    we will probably want sometime. Maybe the easiest thing to do is to start afresh:
    so do that.'

    no matter how much time he spent watching Punjabi soap operas on TV. He did not
    have an easy smile. And yet he found that if he just kept showing up, nothing
    bad would happen, and gradually people would stop noticing him. And that—the simple
    comfort of not being noticed—was all he wanted.

  content: She’d told Ainsley, earlier, walking on the Embankment, how she sometimes
    worried that they weren’t really doing more than just building their own version
    of the klept. Which Ainsley had said was not just a good thing but an essential
    thing, for all of them to keep in mind. Because people who couldn’t imagine themselves
    capable of evil were at a major disadvantage in dealing with people who didn’t
    need to imagine, because they already were. She’d said it was always a mistake,
    to believe those people were different, special, infected with something that
    was inhuman, subhuman, fundamentally other. Which had reminded her of what her
    mother had said about Corbell Picket. That evil wasn’t glamorous, but just the
    result of ordinary half-assed badness, high school badness, given enough room,
    however that might happen, to become its bigger self. Bigger, with more horrible
    results, but never more than the cumulative weight of ordinary human baseness.
    And this was true, Ainsley had said, of the very worst monsters, among whom she
    herself had so long moved. Her job in London, she’d said, might seem to Flynne
    to be a patient caretaker amid large and specially venomous animals, but that
    wasn’t the case. “All too human, dear,” Ainsley had said, her blue old eyes looking
    at the Thames, “and the moment we forget it, we’re lost.”
