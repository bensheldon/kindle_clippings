  content: We can glimpse a sense of this change by distinguishing between commercial
    and noncommercial culture, and by mapping the law’s regulation of each. By “commercial
    culture” I mean that part of our culture that is produced and sold or produced
    to be sold. By “noncommercial culture” I mean all the rest. When old men sat around
    parks or on street corners telling stories that kids and others consumed, that
    was noncommercial culture. When Noah Webster published his “Reader,” or Joel Barlow
    his poetry, that was commercial culture.

    “You can shape your situation and your world.” These ideas are integrated into
    ToP facilitation through a complex of values, practices and application of methodology.
    ToP facilitators often say these things directly because they are using a methodology
    that supports them. ToP methodology provides a process through which an individual
    or a group can pursue, in principle, any inquiry. It enables groups to examine
    their own images or pictures of a situation in relationship to a topic. Each participant
    contributes, from their own perspective, thoughts relevant to the question at
    hand. As the group reflects on the compilation of ideas, their picture of the
    situation grows, develops and changes. They make meaning together.

    in an authentic, future-oriented way. When they have identified their strategies,
    the group can create specific, practical action plans to implement their chosen
    strategies. This process has become known as the ToP Strategic Planning Method.
    ToP action planning rounds out the basic suite of ToP applications. The core of
    this method includes identifying a desired future state, analyzing the hindering
    and supporting factors in the present situation, naming concrete commitments given
    the present reality, generating actions toward those commitments, and timelining
    the actions with assignments and estimated costs. The ToP journey wall applies
    the charting approach to time and historical events to enable a group to look
    at, discuss, create a story of their journey, and learn from their past experience.

  content: Gestalt in this context is about seeing “‘patterns of meaning” in a whole
    set of ideas given in relation to a specific question. The individual responses
    to the focus question will, if the focus question is well-designed, be comprehensive
    in addressing the question. The task is to discern the major themes of thought
    or distinct answers to the given question. There may be many connections and associations
    among the ideas. There may be causes and effects. There may be words that are
    similar or seem to have similar meanings. The key factor in distilling useful
    meaning from this process is the question used as the guide, the focus question.
    It focuses the generation of ideas and guides discernment of the thought patterns
    of the responses. The question becomes the fundamental reference point for a whole
    inquiry and all of its parts. The patterns are named as the group’s response to
    the focus question. It must be understood that this is a process of synthesis
    rather than analysis. One of the easy temptations in performing this process is
    the tendency to sort elements into categories that are already integrated into
    our understanding even if they are not consciously identified. It is, without
    question, much easier for both the participant and the facilitator to sort into
    known categories, but sorting only organizes previous ideas, and does not create
    new ideas. Analytical methodologies play a necessary role in processing ideas
    when an overall framework is already firmly in place.

  content: Western thought emphasizes and teaches analysis, sorting and categorizing
    from an early age. On Sesame Street they ask, “Which of these is not like the
    others?” It is easy to create categories and sort ideas into them, but no new
    knowledge or understanding is created, and “miscellaneous” categories are created,
    effectively marginalizing ideas that are different or outliers. In contrast, the
    consensus workshop method is best used to synthesize new ideas from a diversity
    of individual ideas. This approach completely sidesteps the question of agreeing
    or disagreeing with someone else’s idea; it asks how each unique idea can contribute
    to something the group has not seen before.

  content: Psychologists sometimes refer to the kind of dilemmas described in this
    section as “scriptlessness.” Psychological studies, for instance, find that men
    or women who had experienced unrequited love during adolescence were in most cases
    eventually able to come to terms with the experience and showed few permanent
    emotional scars. But for those who had been the objects of unrequited love, it
    was quite another matter. Many still struggled with guilt and confusion. One major
    reason, researchers concluded, was precisely the lack of cultural models. Anyone
    who falls in love with someone who does not return their affections has thousands
    of years’ worth of romantic literature to tell them exactly how they are supposed
    to feel; however, while this literature provides detailed insight on the experience
    of being Cyrano, it generally tells you very little about how you are supposed
    to feel—let alone what you’re supposed to do—if you’re Roxane.7 Many, probably
    most, bullshit jobs involve a similar agonizing scriptlessness. Not only are the
    codes of behavior ambiguous, no one is even sure what they are supposed to say
    or how they are supposed to feel about their situation.

    happens in such offices is simply pointless, but there is an added dimension of
    guilt and terror when it comes to knowing you are involved in actively hurting
    others. Guilt, for obvious reasons. Terror, because in such environments, dark
    rumors will always tend to circulate about what is likely to happen to whistle-blowers.
    But on a day-to-day basis, all this simply deepens the texture and quality of
    the misery attendant on such jobs.

    about them at least a little—but it very much becomes work when all the empathy

    is not that some people care but that others don’t; that those paying for “services”

    labor themselves. This is even true of a bricklayer, if that bricklayer is working

    people fall into the same dynamic, there’s never such an easy way out. “You can’t

    and could even become the basis for a theory of social liberation. I like to think
    that Michel Foucault, the French social philosopher, was moving in this direction
    before his tragic death in 1984. Foucault, according to people who knew him, underwent
    a remarkable personal transformation on discovering BDSM, turning from a notoriously
    cagey and standoffish personality to one suddenly warm, open, and friendly23—but
    his theoretical ideas also entered into a period of transformation that he was
    never able to fully bring to fruit. Foucault, of course, is famous mainly as a
    theorist of power, which he saw as flowing through all human relationships, even
    as the basic substance of human sociality, since he once defined it as simply
    a matter of “acting on another’s actions.”24 This always created a peculiar paradox
    because while he wrote in such a way as to suggest he was an antiauthoritarian
    opposed to power, he defined power in such a way that social life would impossible
    without it. At the very end of his career, he seems to have aimed to resolve the
    dilemma by introducing a distinction between what he called power and domination.
    The first, he said, was just a matter of “strategic games.” Everyone is playing
    power games all the time, we can hardly help it, but neither is there anything
    objectionable about our doing so. So in this, his very last interview:'

    nuts. Part one is the agitation that necessarily precedes revolution. The second
    part, thesis: a reconstruction of OOP using only the parts that were left over
    after the antithesis. Part two is the manifesto: once we’ve seen that the last
    few decades of status quo haven’t been working for us, we can evaluate something
    that will. The third, synthesis: a discussion of the ideas from OOP that aren’t
    being provided by today’s object systems, and the ideas and problems that OOP
    doesn’t yet address at all. These are the next steps to take to pursue the ideas
    behind object thinking. Part three is the call to action. This is not a pure takedown,
    a suggestion that we have been monotonically doing it wrong for three decades:
    the antithesis part of this book questions, rejects and destroys a lot of built
    aspects of OOP, but by no means all of them. And by no means purely the later
    ones, either: the message is not that Smalltalk was created in some computational
    garden of Eden and that Sun tasted of the forbidden fruit which doomed us all
    to Java. Belief in a primaeval wisdom (urwissenheit) leads to an uncritical “tradition
    for tradition’s sake” in the same way that belief in primaeval stupidity (urdummheit)
    leads to an uncritical “novelty for novelty’s sake”. Rather this is an attempt
    to find a consistent philosophy, a way of thinking about software, and to find
    the threads in the narrative and dialectic history of the making of software that
    are supportive and unsupportive of that way of thinking. Because OOP is supposed
    to be a paradigm, a pattern of thought, and if we want to adopt that paradigm
    then we have to see how different tools or techniques support, damage, or modify
    our thoughts.'

  content: "“Fellow Americans,” he said, pacing his speech to the reverb of the loudspeakers,
    “you have entrusted me with the job of president during a difficult time. The
    crisis we face now, of abrupt climate change and crippling damage to the biosphere,
    is a very dangerous one, to be sure. But we are not at war with anyone, and in
    fact we face a challenge that all humanity has to meet together. On this podium,
    Franklin Roosevelt said, ‘This generation has a rendezvous with destiny.’ Now
    it’s true again. We are the generation that has to deal with the profound destruction
    that will be caused by the global warming that has already been set in motion.
    The potential disruption of the natural order is so great that scientists warn
    of a mass extinction event. Losses on that scale would endanger all humanity,
    and so we cannot fail to address the threat. The lives of our children, and all
    their descendants, depend on us doing so. “So, like FDR and his generation, we
    have to face the great challenge of our time. We have to use our government to
    organize a total social response to the problem. That took courage then, and we
    will need courage now. In the years since we used our government to help get us
    out of the Great Depression, it has sometimes been fashionable to belittle the
    American government as some kind of foreign burden laid on us. That attitude is
    nothing more than an attack on American history, deliberately designed to shift
    power away from the American people. I want us to remember how Abraham Lincoln
    said it: ‘that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall
    not perish from this Earth.’ This is the crucial concept of American democracy—that
    government expresses what the majority of us would like to do as a society. It’s
    us. We do it to us and for us. I believe this reminder is so important that I
    intend to add the defining phrase ‘of the people, by the people, and for the people’
    every time I use the word ‘government,’ and I intend to do all I can to make that
    phrase be a true description. It will make me even more long-winded than I was
    before, but I am willing to pay that price, and you are going to have to pay it
    with me. “So, this winter, with your approval and support, I intend to instruct
    my team in the executive branch of government of the people, by the people, and
    for the people, to initiate a series of federal actions and changes designed to
    meet the problem of global climate change head-on. We will deal with it as a society
    working together, and working with the rest of the world. It’s a global project,
    and so I will go to the United Nations and tell them that the United States is
    ready to join the international effort. We will also help the under-developed
    world to develop using clean technology, so that all the good aspects of development
    will not be drowned in its bad side effects—often literally drowned. In our own
    country, meanwhile, we will do all it takes to shift to clean technologies as
    quickly as possible.” Phil paused to survey the crowd. “My, it’s cold out here
    today! You can feel right now, right down to the bone, that what I am saying is
    true. We’re out in the cold, and we need to change the way we do things. And it’s
    not just a technological problem, having to do with our machinery alone. The devastation
    of the biosphere is also a result of there being too many human beings for the
    planet to support over the long haul. If the human population continues to increase
    as it has risen in the past, all progress we might make will be overwhelmed. “But
    what is very striking to observe is that everywhere on this Earth where good standards
    of justice prevail, the rate of reproduction is about at the replacement rate.
    While wherever justice, and the full array of rights as described in the UN Declaration
    of Human Rights, is somehow denied to some portion of the population, especially
    to women and children, the rate of reproduction either balloons to unsustainably
    rapid growth rates, or crashes outright. Now you can argue all you want about
    why this correlation exists, but the correlation itself is striking and undeniable.
    So this is one of those situations in which what we do for good in one area, helps
    us again in another. It is a positive feedback loop with the most profound implications.
    Consider: for the sake of climate stabilization, there must be population stabilization;
    and for there to be population stabilization, justice must prevail. Every person
    on the planet must live with the full array of human rights that all nations have
    already ascribed to when signing the UN Charter. When we achieve that, at that
    point, and at that point only, we will begin to reproduce at a sustainable rate.
    “To help that to happen, I intend to make sure that the United States joins the
    global justice project fully, unequivocally, and without any double standards.
    This means accepting the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, and
    the jurisdiction of the World Court in the Hague. It means abiding by all the
    clauses of the UN Charter and the Geneva Conventions, which after all we have
    already signed. It means supporting UN peacekeeping forces, and supporting the
    general concept of the UN as the body through which international conflicts get
    resolved. It means supporting the World Health Organization in all its reproductive
    rights and population reduction efforts. It means supporting women’s education
    and women’s rights everywhere, even in cultures where men’s tyrannies are claimed
    to be some sort of tradition. All these commitments on our part will be crucial
    if we are serious about building a sustainable world. There are three legs to
    this effort, folks: technology, environment, and social justice. None of the three
    can be neglected. “So, some of what we do may look a little unconventional at
    first. And it may look more than a little threatening to those few who have been
    trying, in effect, to buy our government of the people, by the people, and for
    the people, and use it to line their own pockets while the world goes smash. But
    you know what? Those people need to change too. They’re out in the cold the same
    as the rest of us. So we will proceed, and hope those opposed come to see the
    good in it. “Ultimately we will be exploring all peaceful means to initiate positive
    changes in our systems, in order to hand on to the generations to come a world
    that is as beautiful and bountiful as the one we were born into. We are only the
    temporary stewards of a mighty trust, which includes the lives of all the future
    generations to come. We are responsible to our children and theirs. What we do
    now will reveal much about our character and our values as a people. We have to
    rise to the occasion, and I think we can and will. I am going to throw myself
    into the effort wholeheartedly and with a feeling of high excitement, as if beginning
    a long journey over stormy seas.”"

    as for an individual? Some spoke of “cognitive mapping” when they discussed taking
    social action—a concept that had been transferred from geography to politics,
    and even to epistemology, as far as Frank could tell. One mapped the unimaginable
    immensity of postmodern civilization (or, reality) not by knowing all of it, which
    was impossible, but by marking routes through it. So that one was not like the
    GPS or the radar system, but rather the traffic controller, or the pilot. At that
    point it became clear even mapping was an analogy. Anna would not think much of
    it. But everyone needed a set of operating procedures to navigate the day. A totalizing
    theory forming the justification for a rubric for the daily decisions. The science
    of that particular Wednesday. Using flawed equipment (the brain, civilization)
    to optimize results. Most adaptive practices. Robustness. Something from ecology,
    from Aldo Leopold: What’s good is what’s good for the land. Something from Rudra
    (although he said from the Dalai Lama, or the Buddha): Try to do good for other
    people. Your happiness lies there. Try it and see. Make the experiment and analyze
    it. Try again. Act on your desires. So what do you really want? And can you really

    to completely adjusted demand is marked by failure, frustration, dire rumors,
    forced choices, and so on down his list. Finally the adjustment is complete, and
    the buyer has abandoned certain intentions, and might even forget them if asked.
    Kornai compares that moment to workers in capitalism who stop looking for work,

    aloud, “ ‘A curious state of equilibrium can arise,’ ” and laughed. “So you just
    give up on your desires! It’s almost Buddhist.”

    the lakeshore. Each day still begins with a version of “Here’s to the gods of
    Tahawus,” a thanksgiving for the day. My work as an ecologist, a writer, a mother,
    as a traveler between scientific and traditional ways of knowing, grows from the
    power of those words. It reminds me of who we are; it reminds me of our gifts
    and our responsibility to those gifts. Ceremony is a vehicle for belonging—to
    a family, to a people, and to the land. At last, I thought that I understood the
    offering to the gods of Tahawus. It was, for me, the one thing that was not forgotten,
    that which could not be taken by history: the knowing that we belonged to the
    land, that we were the people who knew how to say thank you. It welled up from
    a deep blood memory that the land, the lakes, and the spirit had held for us.
    But years later, with my own answer already in place, I asked my father, “Where
    did the ceremony come from—did you learn it from your father, and he from his?
    Did it stretch all the way back to the time of the canoes?” He thought for a long
    time. “No, I don’t think so. It’s just what we did. It seemed right.” That was
    all. Some weeks went by, though, and when we spoke again he said, “I’ve been thinking
    about the coffee and how we started giving it to the ground. You know, it was
    boiled coffee. There’s no filter and if it boils too hard the grounds foam up
    and get stuck in the spout. So the first cup you pour would get that plug of grounds
    and be spoiled. I think we first did it to clear the spout.” It was as if he’d
    told me that the water didn’t change to wine—the whole web of gratitude, the whole
    story of remembrance, was nothing more than the dumping of the grounds? “But,
    you know,” he said, “there weren’t always grounds to clear. It started out that
    way, but it became something else. A thought. It was a kind of respect, a kind
    of thanks. On a beautiful summer morning, I suppose you could call it joy.” That,
    I think, is the power of ceremony: it marries the mundane to the sacred. The water
    turns to wine, the coffee to a prayer. The material and the spiritual mingle like
    grounds mingled with humus, transformed like steam rising from a mug into the
    morning mist.'

    empirical category—an idea you might encounter in a basic sociology textbook,
    where you simply look at someone’s job or income and determine their class. Rather,
    class in the Marxist sense is forged through struggle itself. As the writers of
    1970s journal Zerowork put it, “For us, as Marx long ago, the working class is
    defined by its struggle against capital and not [merely] by its productive function.”

    into account that Marxism is a theory of struggle. The goal of Marx’s critique
    of capitalism was not to provide a set of instructions for managing the economy,
    but to identify the contradictions and fissures, the places where social struggle
    would be likely to emerge. Technology is an important site of these struggles:
    not only is militant opposition to technology a historical fact, but it can suggest
    a more liberatory politics of work and technology—one that is more easily supported
    by Marx’s work than are contemporary post-work utopias.'

  content: 'Legendary IWW activist Elizabeth Gurley Flynn attempted a more precise
    definition in her tract: “sabotage” referred to any effort “to limit his production
    in proportion to his remuneration,” or in other words, “the deliberate withdrawal
    of efficiency by a competent worker.” Rather than argue, as Smith did, for the
    salutary effects of sabotage for class consciousness, Flynn argued that workers
    already engaged in sabotage all the time, but without having a consistent name
    for what they were doing. Flynn quotes a worker at the Paterson silk mill in New
    Jersey, where organizers debated the efficacy of sabotage during the 1913 strike:
    I never heard of this thing called sabotage before Mr. Boyd spoke about it on
    the platform. I know once in a while when I want a half-day off and they won’t
    give it to me I slip the belt off the machine so it won’t run and I get my half
    day. I don’t know whether you call that sabotage, but that’s what I do.29 As Flynn
    noted, “one member of the executive committee after another admitted they had
    used this thing but they ‘didn’t know that was what you called it!’” Flynn’s analysis
    of sabotage was, in this sense, eminently Marxist: rather than dictate strategy
    in a top-down manner, she conceptualized the actually existing tactics of workers
    as a fundamental component of class struggle. “We are to see what the workers
    are doing,” she wrote, “and then try to understand why they do it; not tell them
    it’s right or it’s wrong, but analyze the condition.”'

    history is not a tale of progress, or even a succession of events, but “one single

    that revolutions are the locomotive of world history. But perhaps it is quite
    otherwise. Perhaps revolutions are an attempt by the passengers on this train—namely,
    the human race—to activate the emergency brake.”74 Here an openly decelerationist
    Benjamin emerges. Technology does not lead toward a revolutionary break, nor does
    a revolution necessarily spur on new technological developments. Rather, Benjamin
    reconceives revolution as a cessation of catastrophe. It halts “progress” in its
    tracks.'

    unusual and, when they do occur, are often strained, artificial, and often confusing
    even to managers since they frequently become occasions for the solemn public
    invocation, particularly by high-ranking managers, of conventional moralities
    and traditional shibboleths. What matters on a day-to-day basis are the moral
    rules-in-use fashioned within the personal and structural constraints of one’s
    organization. As it happens, these rules may vary sharply depending on various
    factors, such as proximity to the market, line or staff responsibilities, or one’s
    position in a hierarchy. Actual organizational moralities are thus contextual,
    situational, highly specific, and, most often, unarticulated.'

    try to gauge whether they feel “comfortable” with proposed resolutions to specific

    morality and a reckoning of the practical organizational and market exigencies
    at hand. The notion of comfort has many meanings. When applied to other persons,

    Getting into the corporations presented me with much of what I eventually learned,
    although I realized this only in retrospect.* When I approached my field study
    of managers, I had, for example, no firm grasp of the subtle, ambiguous process
    by which managers assess their colleagues’ moral fitness, so to speak, for managerial
    life. Moreover, I did not know, or at least did not consciously understand, that
    managers would subject me, an outsider desiring to study their occupational morality,
    to the same searching assessment that they continuously make of each other.

    boss’s boss, their patrons, their president, and their CEO, so must they prove
    themselves again and again to each other. Work becomes an endless round of what
    might be called probationary crucibles. Together with the uncertainty and sense
    of contingency that mark managerial work, this constant state of probation produces
    a profound anxiety in managers, perhaps the key experience of managerial work.
    It also breeds, selects, or elicits certain traits in ambitious managers that
    are crucial to getting ahead.

    and subject to the judgments of higher-ups. The price of bureaucratic power is
    a relentlessly methodical subjection of one’s impulses, at least in public. To
    yield to one’s desires in a public setting in a way that others can use against
    one, whether by giving in to the wish for open sexual conquest or proprietary
    claim or by submitting to the temptation to show one’s anger, is seen as irrational,
    unbefitting men or women whose principal claim to social legitimacy is dispassionate
    rational calculation.

  content: 4. Team play also means, as one manager in the chemical company puts it,
    “aligning oneself with the dominant ideology of the moment” or, as another says,
    “bowing to whichever god currently holds sway.” Such ideologies or gods may be
    thought of as official definitions of reality. As I suggested earlier, bureaucracies
    allow their employees a diverse range of private motives for action in return
    for assent to common rules and official versions of reality, that is, explanations
    or accounts that serve or at least do not injure the organization itself. Organizations
    always try, of course, to mobilize employees’ belief in manufactured realities;
    such efforts always meet with some success particularly at the middle levels among
    individuals who still labor under the notion that success depends on sincerity.
    However, the belief of insiders in abstract goals is not a prerequisite for personal
    success; belief in and subordination to individuals who articulate organizational
    goals is. One must, however, to be successful in a bureaucratic work situation,
    be able to act, at a moment’s notice, as if official reality is the only reality.
    The contexts for understanding this meaning of team play are the complicated levels
    of conflict within corporations and the probationary state of mind endemic to
    managerial work.

    spills out of smaller groups into the larger political structures of an organization,

    perspectives” in a strictly collegial context can get interpreted in the political
    or hierarchical arenas as “down-beat negativism” or even “disloyalty.” Wise and
    ambitious managers know that public faces of cheerful cooperativeness, which of

    skill in a world where one must be continually on guard against the eruption of

    even more useless, satire that provokes a few guffaws but only low to middling
    outrage – but is coupled with more talk and no action. A sort of . . . empty cleverness.’

    He asks them to write out the game’s existing rules on the whiteboard and then
    has them brainstorm gameplay adjustments that will ideally create a totally new
    experience. “My favorite variation was when the students altered just one rule:
    If you get three in a row, you lose. It was a small tweak, but it completely changed
    everything. I just thought it was so elegant.” A game becomes exponentially more
    fun once its players learn to get creative within its boundaries. It’s less about
    following the rules and more about filling in the gaps that exist between them.
    Zimmerman uses poker as an example. “There’s nothing in the rules about bluffing,”
    he says. “There’s not a rule that says you can lie if you don’t have a good hand.
    It’s intrinsic to the system. Bluffing is an emergent property that appears out
    of the negative space of the rules.” For a game designer, this is everything.
    It’s how a snow-day diversion evolves into a global phenomenon. “I’m getting chills
    just talking about it,” he says."
