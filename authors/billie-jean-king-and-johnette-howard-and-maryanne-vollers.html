  <ul>
    
      <li>Even if you’re not a born activist, life can damn sure make you one.</li>
    
      <li>I’ve always maintained that tennis players are entertainers, and, as such, we should be paid the same regardless of how many sets we play or what our gender is. We never claimed that we were better than men. What we said was that women put on just as good a show. Now we were proving it.</li>
    
      <li>Once you organize, you have to mobilize. You have to say: How are we going to actually get the change we really want?</li>
    
      <li>The Zulu tribe in South Africa has a term that beautifully expresses a similar thought: Sawubona. It’s a common greeting that literally means, “I see you, you are important to me, and I value you.” It’s meant to encourage each individual to see and respect people as they are, and to pay attention to their virtues and needs, sorrows and desires. When someone says Sawubona to you, a typical response is Shikoba—I exist for you. I value you too.</li>
