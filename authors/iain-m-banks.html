  <h2>Use of Weapons (A Culture Novel Book 3)</h2>

  <ul>
    
      <li>It was a long time later he found out he’d taken the Chosen to the Palace only because the brat was to be the last of the line. Not merely stupid, but also impotent, the Chosen fathered no strong sons and no cunning daughters (as the Culture had known all along), and the fractious desert tribes swept in a de-cade later led by a Matriarch who had guided most of the warriors under her command through the dream-leaf time, and had seen one stronger and stranger than all of them suffer its effects and come through unscathed but still unfulfilled, and known through that very experience that there was more to their desert existence than had been guessed at by the myths and elders of her nomad tribe.</li>
    
      <li>Then the boat split apart, and he dropped through it, through the water underneath, then splashed out of the underside of the water, into air again, and saw the ocean beneath him, and a tiny speck of its surface, which he was falling toward. It was another small boat; he crashed through it, through more water, through more air, through the wreckage of a boat, through another layer of water and another level of air . . . -Hey — one part of his mind thought as he fell — this is like how Sma described the Reality. . . . splashed through more waves, through the water, out into air, heading for more waves . . . This wasn’t going to stop. He remembered that the Reality Sma had described was expanding all the time; you could fall through forever; really forever, not until the end of the universe; literally forever. That won’t do, he thought to himself. He’d have to face the ship. He landed in a little creaking, leaking boat.</li>
    
  </ul>

  <h2>Matter (A Culture Novel Book 8)</h2>

  <ul>
    
      <li>A proper searching, like so many things, was best done on foot, from the ground. Hurling oneself grandly across the sky was all very well and certainly gave the impression of lordly oversight and superiority, but what it really did was give you the opportunity to miss all details at once, rather than one at a time, which was the ration for decent folk.</li>
    
  </ul>

  <h2>Look to Windward (A Culture Novel Book 7)</h2>

  <ul>
    
      <li>“I think that is a little like criticizing somebody for owning both an umbrella and a shower,” Kabe said. “It is the choice that is important.”</li>
    
      <li>“They spend time. That’s just it. They spend time traveling. The time weighs heavily on them because they lack any context, any valid framework for their lives. They persist in hoping that something they think they’ll find in the place they’re heading for will somehow provide them with a fulfilment they feel certain they deserve and yet have never come close to experiencing.” Ziller frowned and tapped at his pipe bowl. “Some travel forever in hope and are serially disappointed. Others, slightly less self-deceiving, come to accept that the process of traveling itself offers, if not fulfilment, then relief from the feeling that they should be feeling fulfilled”. Kabe watched a springleg</li>
    
      <li>“Yes, let’s. Of course, this is always assuming that none of your ship Minds were lying.” “Oh, they never lie. They dissemble, evade, prevaricate, confound, confuse, distract, obscure, subtly misrepresent and willfully misunderstand with what often appears to be a positively gleeful relish and are generally perfectly capable of contriving to give one an utterly unambiguous impression of their future course of action while in fact intending to do exactly the opposite, but they never lie. Perish the thought.”</li>
    
  </ul>
