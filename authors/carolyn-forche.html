  <h2>What You Have Heard Is True</h2>

  <ul>
    
      <li>He introduced me to the word “praxis,” which I understood to mean “human action to change reality” making possible “the liberation of liberty.”</li>
    
      <li>It isn’t the risk of death and fear of danger that prevent people from rising up,” Leonel once said, “it is numbness, acquiescence, and the defeat of the mind. Resistance to oppression begins when people realize deeply within themselves that something better is possible.” He also said that what destroys a society, a state, a government, is corruption—that, and the use of force, which is always applied against those who have not been convinced or included. He was always talking about corruption: trying to prevent it, expose it, eradicate it. He was dedicated to the task of bringing the sin to the eye.</li>
