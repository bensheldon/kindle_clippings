  <h2>The Magicians: A Novel</h2>

  <ul>
    
      <li>“The study of magic is not a science, it is not an art, and it is not a religion. Magic is a craft. When we do magic, we do not wish and we do not pray. We rely upon our will and our knowledge and our skill to make a specific change to the world. “This is not to say that we understand magic, in the sense that physicists understand why subatomic particles do whatever it is that they do. Or perhaps they don’t understand that yet, I can never remember. In any case, we do not and cannot understand what magic is, or where it comes from, any more than a carpenter understands why a tree grows. He doesn’t have to. He works with what he has. “With the caveat that it is much more difficult and much more dangerous and much more interesting to be a magician than it is to be a carpenter.”</li>
    
  </ul>

  <h2>The Magician King: A Novel (The Magicians Book 2)</h2>

  <ul>
    
      <li>“The mistake people make,” Bingle said, “is thinking that there are different styles.” “All right.” “Force, balance, leverage, momentum—these principles never change. They are your style.”</li>
    
  </ul>
