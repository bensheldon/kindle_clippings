  <h2>A Wrinkle in Time (A Wrinkle in Time Quintet Book 1)</h2>

  <ul>
    
      <li>“I’m not talking about my mother’s feelings about my father,” Charles Wallace scolded. “I’m talking about Mrs. Buncombe’s sheets.”</li>
    
      <li>Euripides. Nothing is hopeless; we must hope for everything.” “Where are we now, and how did we get here?”</li>
    
      <li>we can’t take any credit for our talents. It’s how we use them that counts.</li>
    
      <li>we’ve been brought here to help him, not just to find him.”</li>
    
  </ul>

  <h2>A Wind in the Door (A Wrinkle in Time Quintet Book 2)</h2>

  <ul>
    
      <li>“Time isn’t any more important than size. All that is required of you is to be in the Now, in this moment which has been given us.”</li>
    
      <li>“It doesn’t matter where he is, Meg. You’ve got to get it through your head that where doesn’t make any difference in a mitochondrion. It’s why. And how. And who.”</li>
    
  </ul>

  <h2>A Swiftly Tilting Planet (A Wrinkle in Time Quintet Book 3)</h2>

  <ul>
    
      <li>“Ananda,” Mrs. Murry said thoughtfully. “That rings some kind of bell.” “It’s Sanskrit,” Charles Wallace said. Meg asked, “Does it mean anything?” “That joy in existence without which the universe will fall apart and collapse.” “That’s a mighty big name for one dog to carry,” Mrs. Murry said. “She’s a large dog, and it’s her name,” Charles Wallace responded.</li>
    
      <li>“Unicorns find it embarrassing to be thanked. Please desist.”</li>
    
      <li>“People of the settlement!” he cried. “Do you think all power is of the devil? What we have just seen is the wrath of God!”</li>
    
  </ul>
